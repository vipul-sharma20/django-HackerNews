[{"pk": 1, "model": "contacts.newscontent", "fields": {"content": "\n\n\nThe Internet has become the world\u2019s Sorting Hat: it identifies, and increasingly defines, the subculture(s) to which people belong. Does your Facebook feed feature Mother Jones or Fox News? The Guardian or The Telegraph? GamerGate vs Social Justice Warriors. Civil libertarians vs. terror-thumping authoritarians. r/parenting vs. r/childfree. Second Life vs. Digital Detox.\nSuch distinctions existed before the Internet, of course; but they\u2019re far sharper, and far more numerous, today. To quote Balaji Srinivasan of Andreessen Horowitz:\nAn infinity of subcultures outside the mainstream now blossoms on the Internet \u2014 vegans, body modifiers, CrossFitters, Wiccans, DIYers, Pinners, and support groups of all forms. Millions of people are finding their true peers in the cloud.\nI\u2019ve argued before that: \u201cThere is no such thing as majority mainstream culture any more. We are all weirdos now \u2014 thanks to tech.\u201d Instead, the Internet is fragmenting our society into constellations and galaxies of social bubbles. Many are compatible with one another\u2013one can be both a CrossFitter and a DIYer\u2013but many others are mutually exclusive and/or competitive. \nThis is mostly a good thing. Once, government and media gatekeepers could define both \u201cmainstream culture\u201d and its acceptable language of discourse; now, people can, rightly, ignore that kind of attempt to impose the values of the elite onto all of society.\nHowever. It\u2019s OK to live in a bubble; but it\u2019s not OK to not know that you live in a bubble, and/or to be unable to communicate with the rest of the world. However awful and repressive \u201cmainstream culture\u201d may have been, it at least provided a common context for communication. In the world of the Great Fragmentation, this inability to talk to to people who don\u2019t share your bubble\u2019s assumptions is a growing \u2014 albeit often hilarious \u2014 problem.\nI give you this pearl of an example: the Reddit AMA of FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, whose government-bureaucrat-bubble language so infuriated Redditors that they downvoted all of Clyburn\u2019s answers into oblivion, and birthed this superbly scathing comment:\nThis AMA looks to me like a political stunt to say something along the lines of, \u201cYeah, I went on that interweb thing and talked to the American people! We had discussions about everything from Net Neutrality to Eminem!\u201d \u2026 Your answer, which really fell flat in terms of answering the original question, was packed with buzz-words and fluff \u2026 You\u2019re working on making sound policies over a period of time? Excuse my french, but NO SHIT. That\u2019s not what that guy asked. That\u2019s not what the internet asked.\nConsider also this excellent blog post from Fredrik deBoer, regarding:\n\n\n\nthe default code of today\u2019s online social progressives, which I like to call We Are All Already Decided. This is the form of argument that takes as its presumption that all good and decent people are already agreed on the issue in question \u2026 They have no ability at all to express themselves to those who are not already in their tribe. They say terms like \u201cprivilege\u201d or \u201cmansplain\u201d or \u201ctone policing\u201d and expect the conversation to somehow just stop, that if you say the magic words, you have won that round and the world is supposed to roll over to what you want.\n(Read the whole thing, it\u2019s terrific.)\nSo: either our fragmenting subcultures will get better at speaking to those who don\u2019t share the same assumptions, or the inability to do so will amplify and accelerate that fragmentation, and we\u2019ll wind up with a society made of bubbles that don\u2019t understand, trust, or communicate with one another. (Any resemblance to the political culture in today\u2019s America is probably not coincidental.)\nWhich puts me in mind of Meredith Patterson\u2018s talk \u201cStrategies Without Frontiers\u201c\u2013also strongly recommended\u2013which is (in part) about Toby Ord\u2018s work on the \u201csocietal iterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma.\u201d (PDF)\nTo oversimplify, this work takes the classic Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma and expands it to a society of many participants, each with different strategies, who are aware of each other\u2019s actions. Imagine each participant as a subculture, and one can at least envision an (enormously complex) expansion of this approach into \u201csocial simulations\u201d to determine the most likely outcomes of the interactions between subcultures.\nIf so, let\u2019s hope that the emergent properties of larger, more complex systems are very different from Ord\u2019s simplified model. Because in many of its simulations, Absolutists \u2014 those who reject all others who do not subscribe to their purity \u2014 eventually take over the world. (Mind you, \u201cAbsolutist is only really a tenable strategy when there is no noise in the players\u2019 information or actions. If there is a small chance of error in information or action, then Absolutists end up defecting on each other and can never break out of this.\u201d)\nI readily concede that this is all exceedingly handwavey. Moreover, Ord explicitly specifies that his work is \u201ca good model for small populations,\u201d not necessarily applicable to larger societies. But the notion that the fragmentation of our society into well-defined subcultures could lead to it being meaningfully modelled and simulated on a large scale is too appealing to ignore. Never mind Hari Seldon: maybe Big Data can bring us Foundation.\n\nFeatured Image: Meredith Patterson\n"}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "contacts.newscontent", "fields": {"content": "\n\n\nWhen Google announced it was ending the Glass Explorer program yesterday and handing over the reins to Nest\u2019s Tony Fadell, it seemed to exit with more of a whimper than a scream.\nLet\u2019s face it, from its earliest days, people loved to hate Glass.\nIn fact, from the moment Google announced Glass, people reacted harshly to\u00a0the new technology. They simply hated the idea of nerds with computers on their faces who could take photos or videos surreptitiously. A new word, Glassholes, entered the popular lexicon to describe folks who wore Glass.\nIt didn\u2019t seem to matter that we were in the public eye with smartphones all around us taking video and pictures. The idea of a wearable optical\u00a0device seemed to rub folks the wrong way.\nAnd Google encouraged\u00a0a\u00a0sense of elitism by creating the Glass Explorer program, an exclusive club where for the price of $1500, if you were chosen, you could own your very own Glass.\nThe Explorer program was really a stroke of marketing genius. Google\u00a0got\u00a0people to pay for the privilege of beta testing their new wearable technology and reporting back to the company with their findings.\nAnd yes, I actually went through this program; traveling to New York City in June, 2013 for my very own Google Glass adventure. I ponied up the money for the chance to be able to try the latest and greatest wearable, and Google made me feel pretty special in the process.\nI was, after all, one of the chosen few; invited to their posh New York City offices and given a private fitting. Of course I had to pay my own way to get there, and pay for the device.\nBeing one of the chosen few, it turns out wasn\u2019t cheap.\nAnd after I got it home, I found I actually didn\u2019t like a computer on my face or the interface Google had designed for it.\nI found it uncomfortable looking up to see that small screen. What\u2019s more, the operating system consisted of a carousel interface. You could move up and down and side to side within that interface, but your email, texts, tweets, whatever you were reading was on cards and you cycled through them by touching the side of the device. I found this\u00a0awkward and I imagined that over time as more tools developed, the carousel itself would become overcrowded.\n\n\n\nYou could also use your voice, \u201cOK Glass.\u201d But I pictured people in the checkout lines at supermarkets all, muttering commands to their wearables. It didn\u2019t seem like a plausible way of interacting with a computer in public on a regular basis.\nAs it turned out, I wasn\u2019t going to spend $1500 on an item I didn\u2019t enjoy using. I found myself having to force myself to use Glass\u00a0because I simply didn\u2019t like it.\nIn the end, I returned it within the 30 day trial period for a full refund, happy that I had a chance to use the advanced technology, but not willing to make an investment in something I didn\u2019t like and that wasn\u2019t ready for prime time.\nI tried a later version of it last year at SXSW and I felt they had improved it, but clearly Google never felt it was ready for public consumption. They\u00a0never chose to actually release it as a commercial product. Perhaps they sensed what I felt when I tried it, that it would never fly as a mass-consumer device.\nYesterday didn\u2019t necessarily represent the mothballing of Google Glass, but it probably marks the end of any chance of it ever becoming a consumer product. Who knows? Perhaps under the leadership of Nest\u2019s Tony Fadell, it has a shot at becoming a business tool.\nI\u2019ve always thought that the best utility for Glass\u00a0could be in certain niche business situations, perhaps a technician fixing a machine could use it to find necessary documentation, for which it would make sense to have a gadget\u00a0sitting on their face to keep hands-free.\nWhatever happens to Glass now, I still see it as a noble experiment on Google\u2019s part. They tried to find out how far we could go with a wearable device and what society was willing to put up with. It turned out we weren\u2019t terribly comfortable with it, especially the notion of the camera \u2014 even while we were seemingly fascinated with it at the same time.\nPeople\u00a0are still trying to figure out where wearables belong,\u00a0and if it\u2019s\u00a0really necessary to have a machine\u00a0on our wrist, or our face, or hanging off our lapels. Maybe the phone is good enough, but Google tried to push the boundaries, and even though I didn\u2019t like the end result, I still think it was worth the effort.\nIn-article photos by Tomma Henckel.

But when she walked up to the JumpStart booth to chat about the internships they had available, she had absolutely no experience with making games. \u201cI didn\u2019t even have a resume, I had only just become eligible to get a job at all,\u201d she told me last week.\nDespite that, she liked what she heard and applied for the position. When she got to the interview, they didn\u2019t ask about her lack of experience or place too much emphasis on her grades, instead focusing on her interests and personality. \u201cI got lucky,\u201d she says. \u201cI was the worst student until I got the job.\u201d\nRaguimov\u2019s\u00a0first role\u00a0at JumpStart was as a production intern. Her responsibilities included quality assurance, the job that sounds appealing when you\u2019re 12 but in reality is incredibly dull: endlessly playing games to find their bugs. She was taught to use bug-tracking tools and how to update the game studio\u2019s documents.\nThe team also made time to teach her how to describe gameplay mechanics in a\u00a0design document\u00a0and to use their custom tools built on top of the Unity game engine. Nine months after starting at the education game studio, she was struggling in her chemistry class when something clicked.\nShe was looking at the periodic table and its grouping, thinking about Match-3 games (she had been playing a lot of Candy Crush), when she had the epiphany that she could combine the concepts to teach the basics of chemical groupings and reactions in a fun way.\nShe started building out the concept in her own time, using what she had learned on the job to piece together a 30-page design document. She showed the idea to the studio\u2019s curriculum designer, who really liked it and passed it up to her boss. Who then passed it to the CEO of the company. \u201cSuddenly,\u201d Raguimov says, \u201cit was a top priority to get it out.\u201d As this was happening, the studio promoted her from intern to production assistant.\nRaguimov and a team were given about two-and-a-half months to roll the game out. It wasn\u2019t going to launch as a standalone title; instead, the team built it as a mini-game within School of Dragons, the studio\u2019s massively-multiplayer online game based on Dreamworks Animation\u2019s \u201cHow to Train Your Dragons\u201d universe.\n\n\n\nPaulina got to meet \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d star Jay Baruchel at Wondercon.\nIt killed it.\u00a0A month after the mini-game\u2019s release,\u00a0JumpStart CEO David Lord decided they were going to commit even more resources to the concept. It would be a full-on mobile title, with actual level progression and some of the more complex gameplay mechanics Raguimov had thought up in her original design document but weren\u2019t feasible to quickly build into the first release.\nThe team didn\u2019t simply take her idea and run with it, either. She got to lead the creative side of the entire project: while she spent time constructing levels, artists would come to her and ask, \u201cHey, does this match up to what you were imagining?\u201d Raguimov gained experience managing a team of remote programmers, who she would send GIFs and videos to illustrate exactly how the game should feel to play. \u201cIt felt awesome to have all that responsibility,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been craving it ever since.\u201d\nThe end result was How To Train Your Dragon: Alchemy Adventure. Out since fall, the game still gets updates and\u00a0has received an average of five stars from reviews of all versions on the App Store.\n\nRaguimov is officially a Game Designer at JumpStart, working on the studio\u2019s upcoming flagship title. She can\u2019t give any details about it, though she did say, \u201cAfter a year on that last game, I couldn\u2019t look at Match-3s for the longest time.\u201d\nNow 19, she\u2019s working at the studio full-time. She tried to apply for\u00a0a college program that she could do while still keeping the job, but was turned down for the student loans needed to afford the classes. While she says college could still be in her future, she\u2019s happy to keep gaining actual experience at the job she\u2019d like to do going forward.\nDown the road, Raguimov hopes to start her own game development studio. She already knows the kinds of games she\u2019d like to make. \u201cMobile is always a good place because you can reach so many people. But I also like handheld games on the 3DS and PlayStation Vita. They\u2019re great platforms for the games I like: RPGs, beat em\u2019 ups, hack n\u2019 slash. I really like puzzle games with RPG elements on mobile.\u201d\n\n"}}, {"pk": 4, "model": "contacts.newscontent", "fields": {"content": "\n\n\nIt\u2019s a standard Apple play to shave a few atoms off the waists of its\u00a0gadgets come refresh time \u2014 allowing the company\u2019s marketing department to crow\u00a0about\u00a0thinner flagships that\u00a0also pack more power and boast better\u00a0screens, or both.\nIf rumors about a\u00a0next generation model of the\u00a0MacBook Air are\u00a0to be believed, for instance, Apple is planning to slice the laptop\u2019s\u00a0thickness roughly in half, while boosting its\u00a0display size from 11 inches to 12, mostly by reducing the bezel, so its\u00a0overall footprint hardly grows at\u00a0all.\nBut this party trick of packing more into less requires something to give. Likely\u00a0space for certain\u00a0physical ports, in the case of the rumored skeletal\u00a0MacBook Air.\u00a0While, for\u00a0current iPhone flagships, the 6.9mm thick (thin)\u00a0iPhone 6 and the\u00a07.1mm iPhone 6 Plus, a degree of\u00a0form-factor\u00a0integrity has clearly\u00a0been lost in the quest to achieve size 0 smartphones \u2014 hence the\u00a0bendgate\u00a0saga.\niPhones\u00a0that\u00a0weren\u2019t\u00a0quite so thin would probably have stood up a little\u00a0more robustly when people stuck them in their back pockets and sat on them\u00a0for hours. But those aren\u2019t the iPhones Apple\u00a0made.\nStill bendgate is small beer compared to the most complained about compromise of\u00a0slimmer gadgets: battery life. Limiting physical size negatively constrains battery capacity, since the space for housing cells is probably\u00a0shrinking too. It\u2019s certainly not being allowed to balloon, year on year.\nEven though Apple typically optimizes hardware and software\u00a0to offer the same battery life \u2014 or sometimes a slight improvement \u2014 in refreshed devices it\u00a0does not offer headline-grabbing,\u00a0orders of magnitude improvements. Such leaps are reserved for\u00a0its\u00a0new\u00a0chipset or a better display or the aforementioned\u00a0thinner form factor.\nPartly this is because improvements to battery technology have been more incremental than other\u00a0tech developments. But it\u2019s also a measure of the constraints Apple\u2019s external design demands place on the innards of i-Devices. With increasingly slender gadgets, something has to give \u2014 and that something is substantial\u00a0improvements in\u00a0battery life.\nIf Apple was content with a philosophy of \u2018thin enough\u2019\u00a0it could allow a little more space\u00a0inside its gadgets, year on year, to make room for\u00a0bigger batteries\u00a0\u2014 to\u00a0address what remains a very mainstream\u00a0gripe: devices\u00a0that\u00a0give out before their\u00a0users\u00a0do.\nGetting a day\u2019s mixed use from a smartphone remains the\u00a0expected standard. More careful use can\u00a0eke out a little more life. Heavier use will require you to be packing a spare battery or charger. So the irony is that the thinnest, most apparently aspirational gadgets end up being tethered to a wall or attached to an auxiliary battery pack to\u00a0keep them juiced up.\nAnyone who grew up in an earlier technology era, when home computers typically demanded a substantial\u00a0chunk\u00a0of your desk space, and \u2018portability\u2019 meant lugging around a dead-weight with a handle attached, understands Apple\u2019s\u00a0imperative to slim down the kit.\nBut there comes a point where size, surely, no longer matters. Where a phone or a laptop or a computer is\u00a0now thin enough for even the most fashion conscious gadget owner. And yet still Apple thins.\nIts\u00a0consistency here makes slimming\u00a0a\u00a0clear strategy. But what\u2019s the logic of Apple\u2019s\u00a0well-crafted thinness?\nSqueezing rivals\nBuilding\u00a0the thinnest devices, or at least continually pushing in that direction and championing thinness, gives Apple\u2019s competitors very little room for maneuver\u00a0with their own hardware\u00a0designs. It allows Apple to make\u00a0the most of its expertise in\u00a0engineering\u00a0both hardware and software together, working within its own ever tightening margins \u2014 and forcing its rivals to do the same. Or fail trying.\nCompeting gadgets that fail to achieve such slender proportions are\u00a0inevitably compared unfavorably with i-Devices on size and weight. That\u2019s Apple owning the slender top of the market.\nOn the flip side Apple\u00a0arguably has to keep\u00a0raising\u00a0the bar \u2014 or rather shaving the bar \u2014 for what constitutes high end luxury in order to stay ahead of the i-Clones. So this is both a race and a chase.\n\nSlender\u00a0distinction\nAnother factor to consider is that for smartphones and tablets, and even for laptops, hardware differentiation is all but\u00a0dead. Computing devices are mostly screen\u00a0now. Or screen\u00a0plus keyboard. There are so few physical ingredients in the established recipe that it\u2019s all but impossible to blend a distinct flavor.\u00a0Especially with\u00a0Apple owning\u00a0minimalism.\nSo less really can be more when it comes to computing hardware design.\u00a0A more physically differentiated\u00a0design risks being perceived as cluttered or clumsy or ugly or distracting vs the minimalist high end. Again, Apple gets to sit pretty by owning the aesthetic top of the market \u2014 which also\u00a0means it needs to keep building thinner to play by its own reductive rules.\n\nMaking devices\u00a0thinner\u00a0is also one of the\u00a0few ways left to differentiate hardware in a very bland space that\u2019s mostly\u00a0done away with other\u00a0physical\u00a0quirks. Color is another option, and one which Apple plays with from\u00a0time to time, but typically\u00a0for non-flagship devices (like iPods or the iPhone 5c) or\u00a0for its own brand accessories.\nIt keeps its\u00a0truly high end devices\u00a0relatively color-free, with a focus on minimalist monochromes and metallics. And so\u00a0Apple needs to make its\u00a0devices\u00a0thinner, year on year, to achieve a\u00a0design\u00a0splash.\nTighter\u00a0control\nAnother characteristic of thinner devices is how they\u00a0naturally\u00a0reduce interaction\u00a0choice for the user \u2014 with fewer physical entry points into these devices. They\u00a0are shiny shells encouraging greater reliance on the walled garden ecosystem that created them. Physical ports and slots are pared back to a bare minimum. Storage is probably not user-expansible. Batteries aren\u2019t replaceable.\n\n\n\nAll of which limits what users can do vis-a-vis the iOS ecosystem, and makes their behaviour more predictable and controllable. That in turn allows Apple to construct a more accessible environment, with fewer available choices supporting\u00a0a simpler, more mainstream-friendly interface.\nIf the user can\u2019t do things like expand storage themselves,\u00a0or buy a replacement battery, they\u00a0can be more easily nudged by Apple to\u00a0pay for cloud storage\u00a0or encouraged to upgrade to a new i-Device. It\u2019s all about\u00a0funneling users along the\u00a0Cupertino-controlled pipe.\n\nThese constraints help with ecosystem lock-in too. The more invested the user becomes in the iOS ecosystem and Apple\u2019s iCloud, the more locked in to its\u00a0hardware\u00a0they are\u00a0\u2014 with the cumulative build up of associated digital\u00a0content working to\u00a0dissuade them from switching to another platform.\nSlender, reductive devices are therefore a visual expression of the ecosystem lock in which\u00a0give\u00a0Apple\u2019s business its staying power.\nLimited lifespan\nBuilding thinner hardware\u00a0also means the most perishable\u00a0piece of technology inside i-Devices \u2014 the\u00a0battery \u2014 is\u00a0locked away inside a seamless shell. With no user access,\u00a0the lifespan of the mobile device\u00a0become inextricably (literally)\u00a0linked\u00a0to the\u00a0overall lifespan of the battery.\nYou could even argue that constrained battery capacity helps to encourage user charging patterns that wear a\u00a0battery out more quickly. Smartphone users typically charge their devices every night, since battery life is limited, and if they are using the phone a lot in the day might well discharge the device entirely. Which is\u00a0not necessarily a great way to treat\u00a0lithium-ion cells if you want them to last\u2026\nEither way, the bottom line is Apple makes money\u00a0when device users upgrade, and given its business involves selling\u00a0expensive devices\u00a0that are\u00a0crafted\u00a0from premium materials the most common reason for an upgrade \u2014 certainly for Apple\u2019s mobile devices \u2014 is a worn out battery. Hardware thinness thus helps Apple generate and regulate recurring\u00a0revenue.\n\u00a0\nAnd now for\u00a0Apple\u2019s next trick\u2026\nSo\u00a0what\u2019s the end game? Can Apple keep making its i-Devices thinner and thinner? Obviously it would\u00a0hit some\u00a0atomic limits eventually, but it still has a few millimeters left for sacrificing to the gods of thinness before it gets to that point \u2014 which, at its typically yearly refresh cycle \u2014 should keep the strategy ticking over in the short term.\nIn the meanwhile Apple is\u00a0building a new type of wearable device, the Apple Watch, due to arrive this March. This is new territory for Apple, with the\u00a0smartwatch being\u00a0auxiliary\u00a0to the core\u00a0computing devices in its portfolio. So it\u00a0opens up the possibility of\u00a0a little\u00a0strategic expansion of\u00a0its hardware philosophy.\n\nThe Apple Watch\u00a0is a supplementary device that offers a degree of\u00a0function and design flare overspill, while allowing Apple to maintain the slender form-factors\u00a0of the\u00a0master iOS devices it is intended to be used with.\nIt is also supplementary in the sense that it aims to lift extra\u00a0dollars out of the wallets of existing iOS users. It is of course\u00a0another iOS\u00a0lock-in incentive. And one which seeks\u00a0to expand the reach and knowledge of the ecosystem, by attaching an\u00a0even more personal data point to users. And while wearables as a consumer electronics category have, thus far, been pretty uninspiring Apple will be aiming to break the mould \u2014 as it\u00a0has a history of doing so.\nApple also has a history of being\u00a0comfortable\u00a0cannibalizing its own business\u00a0\u2014 building the iPhone to\u00a0absorb the iPod\u2019s function, for instance. And more recently making a phablet-sized iPhone, despite plenty of overlap with its smaller iPads.\u00a0Where the\u00a0Apple Watch will fit in on this function overlap spectrum is not clear at this point. That will depend on sales\u00a0and how unique (or otherwise) the app experiences are vs iPhone/iPad. But it seems likely that some cannibalization is coming.\nEither way, that\u2019s fine for Apple\u2019s hardware business, given the watch uses\u00a0Bluetooth\u00a0connectivity \u2014 requiring it to link\u00a0to an iPhone to function. Apple\u2019s main concern here will be ensuring the Watch offers new utility to wearers to justify that second purchase.\nPart of the utility of the\u00a0Apple Watch is likely to be the ability to check notifications without needing to dip into\u00a0a bag or pocket to\u00a0do so. Perhaps even without needing to view a screen at all (e.g.\u00a0haptic feedback informing the watch wearer to turn as they walk). So not needing to check an iPhone quite so much. Or not as much as you\u00a0otherwise would.\nDepending on how\u00a0well\u00a0Apple manages the\u00a0Bluetooth link with the iPhone, the Apple Watch\u00a0could then effectively function\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0wearable spare battery pack for iPhone users \u2014 if it\u00a0ends up\u00a0re-routing enough usage away from\u00a0the primary mobile device to an\u00a0auxiliary wearable.\nIf that\u2019s the case, Apple\u2019s 2015\u00a0party trick could\u00a0be more slender iPhones with\u00a0battery life that\u00a0appears improved\u00a0\u2014 thanks to a portion of\u00a0mobile usage being re-routed to the Apple Watch\u00a0\u2014 while simultaneously\u00a0making\u00a0more money from its user-base.\nQuite the sleight of hand, if Apple can pull it off.\n\n\n"}}, {"pk": 5, "model": "contacts.newscontent", "fields": {"content": "\n\n\nSo many eyeballs, so little growth.

While Yahoo has acquired nearly 50 companies during Mayer\u2019s tenure, its financial results have done little to persuade investors that the company has found a path to growth.\nThat has raised questions about the viability of the app studio model. Unlike platform product companies like Facebook, app studios rely on monetizing a portfolio of products. Among mobile app companies, this business structure is most common in the games industry, and indeed, there are certain parallels to Hollywood movie studios with their focus on entertainment franchises.\nThere is one startup, though, that is proving that an app studio model can exist outside of pure entertainment, and incredibly, is devouring startups at an average rate of almost 5 per month.\nYello Mobile, a Korean startup founded in 2012, has now acquired a total of 74 apps for its portfolio, 61 of which were acquired just in the last year. And the company shows no sign of slowing down, pushing to conduct about the same number of transactions in 2015 as it did last year.\nThe company is taking advantage of a unique moment in the market in its home base of Seoul and throughout Asia. Mobile usage has skyrocketed throughout the region, none more so than in South Korea, where smartphone penetration is nearing 75% of the population, and the country is already transitioning its wireless infrastructure to 5G technologies.\nThe rapid adoption of mobile in the country has not been matched by its leading technology and service providers. That means there are huge gaps between the needs of users and the offerings of incumbent companies. Lee Sang-hyuck, the CEO of Yello Mobile says that \u201cThere are many niche markets beyond gaming and messaging that are underserved and underdeveloped in Asia. We are targeting those aggressively, to support the stars in each vertical and also help develop those opportunities.\u201d\nThe company targets startups that are 2\u20133 years old, and thus have proven market traction, but are perhaps struggling to grow. Yello\u2019s key skill is taking these existing properties and growing them even more rapidly. For example, Coocha collects data on various ecommerce merchants and presents this information to users in its app. It had 850,000 monthly active users when the company was acquired by Yello in May 2013, and now has almost 3 million users. Perhaps more importantly, its sales revenues have gone from $160,000 to $810,000 according to the company.\nWhile there is some diversity in the revenue models of the apps, advertising remains core to most, and the company has prioritized building that capability through its acquisitions. Yello owns the second largest mobile ad network in Korea, a startup known as Cauly or Future Stream Networks, which is currently used by 12,000 apps. Yello acquired the company for $27 million earlier in 2014, and already has already grown its profits from $100,000 per month to $1.2 million.\nAs it builds up its portfolio of properties, it is able to find operational synergies like its advertising network, but also cross-promote brands across its apps. As its studio model continues to grow, its marketing and distribution costs continue to fall, heightening the potential value of each acquisition.\n\n\n\nThat unmet consumer demand is only half of this window of opportunity. The other side is the incredibly small mergers and acquisitions market in South Korea and much of Asia. Despite the formation of thousands of startups in Korea in just the last few years, there remains a pitifully small number of transactions conducted every year. MergerMarket estimates that the number of deals done per quarter in Korea to be under 80.\nThere are largely two reasons for this. Large conglomerates like Samsung are mostly uninterested in buying technology they didn\u2019t develop. In fact, Samsung has made few acquisitions in its history, with the notable exception of last summer\u2019s purchase of SmartThings. Additionally, Korean capital markets are not as well developed to finance these sorts of transactions like in the U.S., making it difficult to bring these transactions to a close.\nThat means that Yello can buy apps at a significant markdown, particularly compared to the value of similar performing apps in the United States. The average valuation for a startup at acquisition by Yello has been $3.6 million. Across the 61 startups it purchased in 2014, the company spent just $111 million total.\nPerhaps even more shocking though is the returns for the investors on these apps. The low expected valuations for exits in the Korean M&A market also influences the valuations of venture capital rounds. Korean startup founders find it challenging to raise capital at even ten times the price of capital in Silicon Valley. Yello told me that investors received an average return of 2x across the exits to the company.\nYello\u2019s strategy, besides being profitable, is also remarkably important for the growth of the local startup ecosystem. While a 2x return to investors is not going to return a venture fund, such exits significantly change the risk structure for venture capitalists in an environment where bankruptcies can be devastating. By building a pipeline for startups to actually get to an exit, a positive cycle for venture activity can finally begin in Korea.\nWhile incredible consumer demand for mobile apps and cheap M&A has made Yello\u2019s model quite valuable, all of that app eating certainly requires venture capital. The company has already received about $161 million in venture capital, most recently a $100 million infusion in a round led by Formation8. That round valued the company at $1 billion, a number that could jump higher in the next few weeks. Yello\u2019s CEO is targeting an IPO on NASDAQ in 2016, potentially offering investors another vehicle by which to get exposure to the massive tech growth in Asia.\nAnd then suddenly, we head back to the story of that other app studio with a five-letter word starting with Y. For Yello, its pitch to investors has to get past Yahoo\u2019s dismal experience, and it needs to emphasize not only the synergy across its properties, but the truly unique moment that it is taking advantage of within the Asian ecosystem.\nIf its massive diet for startups can lead to a durable portfolio, Yello may have accomplished what Yahoo so far couldn\u2019t: building a high-growth mobile media business.\n\nFeatured Image: 401(K) 2012/Flickr UNDER A CC BY-SA 2.0 LICENSE\n"}}, {"pk": 6, "model": "contacts.newscontent", "fields": {"content": "\n\n\nGames and the formula that leads to their success can be a bit of a mystery, perhaps more so on mobile. One of 2014\u2019s big hits, both in terms of critical and audience success, was Monument Valley by ustwogames.\nThe isometric 3D puzzler was breathtaking\u00a0in terms of its visual design and had\u00a0nice\u00a0mechanics, and it managed to earn nearly $6 million in revenue from over 2.4 million individual app sales. But the cost of development might surprise you, as well as the completion rate for the game\u2019s relatively short story among paying players.\n\nMonument Valley counted 2,440,076 official sales, which includes iOS, Google Play, Amazon Paid and Amazon Free (via featuring) app installs. iOS drove the brunt of the official DLs (the Android launch also resulted in a piracy rate of around 95 percent, ustwo revealed previously), while Amazon\u2019s free release drove about 4 times as many downloads as did its paid sales.\u00a0All told, those downloads drove $5,858,625 in revenue to date, with the single biggest revenue day coming on the original iOS launch day, when the title netted $145,530 in 24 hours.\nApple\u2019s reputation for being the platform developers go to in order to make money seems to hold true to ustwogames\u2019 experience \u2013 81.7 percent of the revenue for Monument Valley came from Apple\u2019s mobile platform, while only 71.1 percent of its total official downloads originated on the iPhone and iPad. Over 10,000,000 devices actually saw Monument Valley installed, despite the official sales total, which includes users putting it on multiple gadgets, family share installs, and the huge obfuscated beast that is unauthorized downloads.\n\n\n\n\nUstwo also breaks down traffic over time, with the noteworthy events in the game\u2019s history marked to explain spikes. The key takeaway here really is that just about any press or media attention can help spark a run, though launches were the most powerful, (including the launch of Forgotten Shores), as well as Christmas.\nEven accolades like the Apple Design Award Monument Valley picked up at WWDC last year, and the iPad Game of the Year nod it got near year-end couldn\u2019t come anywhere close to competing with just making new content available.\n\nThe other really interesting detail that ustwogames shared is the total development cost of both the original game and the Forgotten Shores expansion: 55 weeks of development time for Monument Valley proper cost $852,000, while a 29-week development cycle for Forgotten Shores was worth $549,000 in team salaries and incidentals.\nAlso worth noting are the game completion rates: Monument Valley is rare in that players are paying upfront for a complete experience with a plot that you can work through in less than a day, yet only 50 percent of players who started finished the game. 24 percent of Monument Valley customers paid for Forgotten Shores. Despite the 5 percent completion rate, however, players somewhat unexpectedly tended to play later chapters more often than earlier ones, especially when talking about the original level set.\nMonument Valley is somewhat of an outlier in terms of mobile games, in that it eschews the freemium model favoured by many of the top-grossing titles these days. But the stats they\u2019re offering still provide a great resource for anyone thinking about trying anything similar, or for players\u00a0just curious about how the mobile gaming industry works from the other side.\n\n"}}, {"pk": 7, "model": "contacts.newscontent", "fields": {"content": "\n\n\n\u201cWhose phone charger is that sticking out of the wall?

Most notably, Microsoft-branded wireless keyboards. We\u2019re still trying to dig up a more exhaustive list \u2014 but for now, let \u201cMicrosoft wireless keyboard\u201d be your caution sign.\nIn a statement, Microsoft notes that it only affects its 2.4 Ghz (not Bluetooth) keyboards released before July 2011 (Update: See the bottom of this post for a note on this from Samy, the man behind the hack). Even if it\u2019s \u201conly\u201d older keyboards, remember: outside of the gamer crowd, most people don\u2019t update their keyboards very often.\nHere\u2019s some of the crazier stuff KeySweeper can do:\n\n\n\n\nSniff out keystrokes as you type them.\nIf it detects certain keystrokes (like \u201cTopSecretWebsite.com\u201d), it can grab the chunk of text that follows (like your username and password) and send it over SMS to whoever planted the device.\nStore keystroke logs on the device itself. These logs can be extracted from the device by hardwired USB, or by putting a second KeySweeper device within range of the first (like, say, an outlet on the other side of the wall).\nWhen plugged in, it grabs its power from the wall.\nWhen unplugged from the wall by an abnormally suspicious bystander, it looks like it powers down \u2014 but it actually just switches to battery power. Logging/sending continues. Naaaasty.\n\nOn the upside, most brand-name wireless keyboards sold today use encryption methods that are a bit tougher to crack. Logitech, for example, uses 128-bit AES on all of its wireless stuff (see page 6 of this doc for reference).\nSamy estimates that each unit would cost $10 to $80 to build, depending on what sort of features you want (ditching the SMS support, for example, brings it down by about $45) \u2014 but is quick to note that he\u2019s not actually selling these.\nYou can (and should!) read Samy\u2019s full breakdown of the project over here.\nUpdate: While Microsoft says only keyboards before July 2011 are impacted, Samy shot me a note to point out that said keyboards are still on sale and seemingly manufactured:\n\nJust wanted to mention \u2014 while Microsoft states it only affects keyboards before 2011, the vulnerable keyboards are *still* being manufactured and sold today, even from Microsoft\u2019s own web site and major retailers like Best Buy.\nI purchased the vulnerable keyboard brand new from Best Buy just last month, and the date next to the serial number says \u201c07/2014\u2033\n\n\n\n"}}, {"pk": 8, "model": "contacts.newscontent", "fields": {"content": "\n\n\nIt was a big week for Google, Elon Musk, and the UK Prime Minister.

From what we understand, developers who are affected could theoretically change their address, say to a Russian or a Ukranian one, and will again be allowed to join RAD program. We will update as we learn more.\n\n\n\nThe backstory lies in a classic case of using economics as a diplomatic lever. Apple\u2019s move is in response to\u00a0an Executive Order signed by U.S. President Barack Obama on December 19, which describes \u201cadditional steps to address the Russian occupation of the Crimea.\u201d\u00a0The region, a peninsula that juts into the Black Sea, has less than 2 million inhabitants, but it has become a bone of contention over tensions between Ukraine and Russia.\nThe U.S. has sided\u00a0with Ukraine in opposing Russia\u2019s annexation of it in March 2014, and these measures \u2014 made to fall in line with similar sanctions crafted by the European Union \u2014 are intended to tighten the screws on Russia to relent.\nTechnology squarely\u00a0falls into the items that the U.S. cites in the order. Among the various activities that are now prohibited are new investment in the region by a U.S. person; the importation into the U.S.\u00a0\u201cdirectly or indirectly, of any\u00a0goods, services, or technology from the Crimea region of Ukraine\u201d; and \u201cthe exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly,\u00a0from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located,\u00a0of any goods, services, or technology to the Crimea region of Ukraine\u201d. Other areas covered in the order include investments and immigration.\nBefore this, there have been other moments where Apple\u2019s business with Russia has been called into question.\nThe company at one point last month closed its online store as the value of the Ruble plunged. It then reopened it several days later with prices up by 35% (which is huge, considering that Apple products were already priced at a big premium for the average buyer). Nevertheless, with a population of\u00a0144 million people and a strong tech culture,\u00a0the country represents a lot of emerging market opportunity for Apple (and others).\nTech companies have faced problems\u00a0in Russia of another kind as well: Putin\u2019s government has put in place measures for tracking data on websites, and\u00a0restrictions on certain types of content. This has resulted in some sites, like Github, getting blocked, and others, like Intel, shutting down some of their online operations.\n\nFeatured Image: Illya Kondratyuk/Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE\n"}}, {"pk": 10, "model": "contacts.newscontent", "fields": {"content": "\n\nHappy Sunday!

She\u00a0has active investments in companies including m-commerce players Care.com, EAT Club, and ThredUP.\u00a0Phil Carter\u00a0is an associate at\u00a0Trinity Ventures, where he focuses on mobile-enabled marketplaces and services and has supported recent investments in RelayRides and ZIRX.\u00a0\nLast year represented a tipping point in\u00a0mobile\u00a0commerce\u00a0investment, so as we begin\u00a0a new year,\u00a0we wanted to take stock by updating our m-commerce market map and offering our\u00a0predictions\u00a0for\u00a02015.\n\nA\u00a0recent report by Digi-Capital estimates that VCs invested\u00a0$4.2 billion in m-commerce from Q3 2013 to Q3 2014, far surpassing the\u00a0$1.2 billion invested in 2013 and the $829 million invested in the previous two years combined. While much of this capital was poured into a few multibillion dollar juggernauts like\u00a0Uber\u00a0and\u00a0Pinterest, it has also continued to fuel an explosion of m-commerce startups, including several in new subcategories.\nIn marketplaces, startups like\u00a0EatWith\u00a0and\u00a0Feastly\u00a0are betting they can replicate the success of P2P models like\u00a0Airbnb\u00a0and\u00a0RelayRides\u00a0to disrupt the $600 billion U.S. restaurant industry with in-home dining experiences. Meanwhile, On-Demand Services are emerging in several new subcategories, particularly in dense urban areas with high-frequency use cases. ZIRX\u00a0and\u00a0Luxe\u00a0make commercial parking easier with on-demand valet services that let drivers drop cars off wherever they want, with optional add-on services like gas refills and car washes included.\nAnd B2B models like\u00a0Keychain Logistics,\u00a0Cargomatic, and\u00a0Deliv\u00a0are revolutionizing logistics at every part of the supply chain. Finally, in app-based services, there\u2019s been a proliferation of new businesses focused on\u00a0mobile\u00a0health and wellness from\u00a0Rise\u00a0and\u00a0Kurbo Health\u00a0in nutrition to\u00a0Lantern,\u00a0Talkspace, and\u00a07 Cups of Tea\u00a0in mental health, among many others.\nThese startups are leveraging smartphones to intercept users in the course of their daily routines and help them to lead healthier, happier lives. We also added education and productivity, two established app-based service categories that did not appear in the first version of the market map.\nGiven that\u00a0mobile\u00a0devices only account for\u00a01 percent of the $3.25T U.S. retail spending market, m-commerce is clearly still in its infancy, and we expect continued rapid growth in\u00a02015.\nA year of reckoning for on-demand services\nIf there was one m-commerce theme that summed up 2014, it was the explosion in on-demand services. In the last 12 months, many articles have been written about the \u201cUberification\u201d of our economy, with\u00a0Steve Schlafman\u2019s deck\u00a0published in April providing a helpful summary.\nThis trend has been led by Uber itself, whose value skyrocketed from a few billion dollars at the beginning of 2014 to\u00a0$17 billion in June\u00a0and\u00a0$41 billion in its most recent $1.2 billion round. Yet there have been plenty of on-demand services that have failed to replicate Uber\u2019s success, including many of Uber\u2019s competitors in the ridesharing space that\u00a0have struggled to demonstrate either exponential growth or positive contribution margins.\nAt issue for some on-demand services is not only intense competition in certain subcategories, but that their value proposition is not dramatically better than that of incumbents.\nFor example, in the home cleaning and laundry service categories, the benefits provided by a\u00a0mobile\u00a0application are less dramatic relative to ridesharing because these services are typically not delivered on a truly on-demand basis.\n\n\n\nIn subcategories where the market size is too small, the capital required to scale is too large, or the improvement relative to incumbent models is too marginal,\u00a0we expect there to be a significant shakeout in\u00a02015\u00a0as VC investment in on-demand services slows down and startups with no discernable path to profitability sell or go out of business.\nThe rise of visual commerce\nThe web is an increasingly visual experience, and it\u2019s no secret that companies have capitalized on this trend by using photo rich content to attract large user bases. Pinterest is perhaps the poster child of this movement, having amassed\u00a060-70 million users\u00a0that are now being monetized through the use of promoted pins. Similarly, e-commerce companies such as\u00a0Zulily\u00a0have learned that high-quality photos consistently boost conversion rates.\nOn\u00a0mobile, photos are even more important given small screen sizes, and contextual commerce\u00a0companies large and small are increasingly using photos not just to acquire users but to monetize them.\nAccording to a Pew Research Center survey conducted last year,\u00a018 percent of smartphone users were using Instagram and 9 percent were using Snapchat as of October 2013. And just as Pinterest did on the web, these apps are creating new forms of visual advertising to capitalize on their user traffic.\nInstagram launched video ads\u00a0in October, letting brands directly target users in their feeds rather than relying on traffic to their corporate accounts, and expectations are that the service will introduce commercial transaction capabilities.

We see this pattern in\u00a0mobile\u00a0health, where\u00a0Glow\u00a0and\u00a0Ovuline\u00a0have amassed highly engaged female user bases with initial products focused entirely on personalized fertility tracking and pregnancy support, and in personal finance, where apps like\u00a0ActiveHours\u00a0and\u00a0MileIQ\u00a0have achieved impressive app store rankings despite targeting narrow initial use cases in payday loans and business mileage tax deductions, respectively.\nGoing into\u00a02015,\u00a0we expect the trend toward specialization to expand into many other app-based service subcategories.\nAnnual m-commerce investment activity has risen more than 10x over the last few years. Every quarter, entirely new subcategories of\u00a0mobile-enabled services are emerging, and we expect the momentum to continue in\u00a02015\u00a0as VCs invest behind trends such as visual\u00a0commerce\u00a0and specialized app-based services. At the same time, in crowded categories like on-demand services, we\u00a0predict\u00a0that competition and heavy capital requirements will force consolidation over time, with players that have established positive contribution margins and favorable customer acquisition economics emerging as winners.\n\nFeatured Image: Pavel Ignatov/Shutterstock\n"}}, {"pk": 12, "model": "contacts.newscontent", "fields": {"content": "\n\n\nPresident Obama took executive action last November\u00a0to further ease policies around skilled tech labor.\u00a0However,\u00a0our laws haven\u2019t done much to help the foreign startup founders who create quite a few tech jobs here.\nA\u00a02008 Kaufman Foundation\u00a0study concluded that between 1995 and 2005,\u00a0more than half\u00a0of all Silicon Valley\u00a0tech companies were created by immigrant founders, employing 560,000 workers and generating $63 billion in sales.\nBut something changed in 2006. There was a commonly estimated 12 million illegals\u00a0living in America at the time. New reforms that were supposed to make it easier for immigrants who\u2019d been here a while to obtain worker visas seemed to be making it harder for those with startups.\nThe Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006\u00a0allowed those who\u2019d been in the country for 2-5 years to\u00a0stay, but would required them to\u00a0return to their country of origin after 3 years. Meanwhile, those who\u2019d been here less than 2 years would have to leave.\nVivek Wadwha\u00a0suggested in his book \u2018The Immigrant Exodus\u2019 that the changes to U.S. immigration policy was causing a brain drain in Silicon\u00a0Valley.\nThis was seemingly\u00a0confirmed in a\u00a0follow-up Kaufman study, showing that the number of immigrant-founded startups dropped from 52 percent to less than 44 percent in 2012.\nThis suggests would-be Silicon Valley entrepreneurs\u00a0were having a harder time getting the visas they needed to start businesses here.\nSource: Kaufman Foundation\nU.S. employers can currently sponsor foreign workers with a temporary H-1B visa. However, those visas are capped at 65,000 a year. This limits the amount of workers able to stay and add to the economy here.

William Mougayar is an entrepreneur turned angel investor, founder of Startup Management, and currently raising his first fund.\n\u201cYou never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.\u201d\u00a0- Buckminster Fuller\nThe bitcoin train is really made up of two revolutions in one: money and finance, based on the bitcoin protocol, and exploiting the \u201ccurrency programmability\u201d aspects; and decentralized applications, based on the blockchain\u2019s distributed technology capabilities.\nBoth are grounded in similar roots (crypto-technology), but they have different branching. Both paths are creating disruptive, innovative and system-changing opportunities for startups, investors, consumers and business players. Both are joined at the hip, and that hip is the blockchain, the backbone of crypto-based transactions.\nTo fully understand the blockchain concept and the benefits of cryptography in computer science, we need to first understand the concept of \u201cdecentralized consensus,\u201d a key tenet of the crypto-based computing revolution.\nDecentralized consensus breaks the old paradigm of centralized consensus, i.e. when one central database used to rule transaction validity. A decentralized scheme (which the bitcoin protocol is based on) transfers authority and\u00a0trust to a decentralized network and enables its nodes to continuously and sequentially record their transactions on a public \u201cblock,\u201d creating a unique \u201cchain\u201d \u2014 the blockchain. Cryptography (via hash codes) is used to secure the authentication of the transaction source and removes the need for a central intermediary. The combination of cryptography and blockchain technology together ensures there is never a duplicate recording of the same transaction.\nThis degree of unbundling is enabling a new way of writing software, and it is a spark of innovation for money- and non-money-related decentralized applications.\nThere are different flavors of crypto-technology-related implementations. Some are based on the bitcoin blockchain itself and others on an independent decentralized one. Some are based on the bitcoin currency and others on alternative cryptocurrencies or branded tokens. All these various permutations are creating a rich ecosystem environment for cryptocurrency-based innovations.\nTo say that bitcoin and its sole blockchain hold a monopoly on the future of cryptocurrency-based implementations is like saying in 2006 that LinkedIn was the only\u00a0social\u00a0network needed when it was barely leading, and when Facebook, Twitter and many other\u00a0social\u00a0platforms were still babies.\nWe need to view what is happening today as a rich ecosystem that represents the best blend of computer and cryptography science, and not just as an ecosystem of bitcoin-centric technologies.\nA future that relies only on bitcoin and its blockchain is simply not possible. The cat is already out of the bag, and innovation around cryptocurrency technologies is racing. At the center of it,\u00a0trust\u00a0is shifting from humans and central organizations to computers and decentralized organizations with an underlying decentralized consensus that governs them.\nIf the social web\u00a0dominated the period of 2004-2014, the next 10 years might as well belong to the trust web.\nWhat most people don\u2019t realize is that bitcoin is just a protocol, and a pretty low-level one to start with. Any heavy lifting happens on top of it, just as TCP/IP is the Internet\u2019s protocol and a pretty low-level one. The ecosystem in and around bitcoin is actually helping to enrich bitcoin, more than weaken it.\nCompanies and projects such as\u00a0Ethereum,\u00a0Blockstream,\u00a0Maidsafe,\u00a0Mastercoin,\u00a0Counterparty,\u00a0Stellar,\u00a0Factom,\u00a0Codius\u00a0and\u00a0NXT\u00a0are innovating with new technologies, services and applications that are pushing or testing the limits of\u00a0Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original vision.\nToday, the bitcoin landscape is still murky, but patterns are emerging. The picture isn\u2019t totally clear, but here\u2019s an inventory of where we are seeing some of the most exciting and promising entrepreneurial activity, both in the money and decentralized applications segments.\nMoney services\nIf you live in the Western world, or a relatively developed country, your banking system and currency are typically stable, and you\u2019re probably happy with the services offered. But according to studies, half the world is unbanked and undocumented, and more than 4 billion people still don\u2019t have Internet access.\nTo peer into the future of decentralized banking for the masses, look no further than the success of\u00a0easypaisa\u00a0in Pakistan and\u00a0M-Pesa\u00a0in Kenya. They are both SMS-based, cell phone-centric banking services that enjoy a wide user adoption for paying bills, transferring money, buying goods and services, and several other types of transactions. Easypaisa already holds more than a 50 percent market share in mobile financial transactions in Pakistan, and M-Pesa enjoys more than 70 percent market usage penetration in Kenya (higher than Facebook\u2019s), and accounts for over 30 percent of that country\u2019s GDP.\nYou might think that SMS-based transactions are a pretty simplistic scheme, but that may be exactly what\u2019s needed: a return to simplicity. Bitcoin is all about that.\nMicrotransactions and money transfer\nBitcoin is perfect for micro-transactions. There is no reason why any\u00a0web\u00a0transaction under $10 shouldn\u2019t be done using bitcoin. Credit cards or PayPal really have no place at the low-end of transaction value because transaction fees easily eat into the total transaction itself. Some of the early applications include tipping for a variety of reasons (appreciation, reward, donations, etc.) or as promotional gifts for marketing purposes. Some bloggers are even adding tipping buttons on their sites, perhaps signaling that tipping is the new \u201cliking.\u201d\nOn the higher end of money operations, money transfers are ideally suited for bitcoin\u2019s native network structure, and the $400 billion-plus global remittance market is waiting to get disrupted, as bitcoin is lowering the costs of transmitting money by orders of magnitude in speed and simplicity. Further, we will soon become regular users of cryptocurrency wallets with built-in logic that will allow you to initiate money transfers or payments via programmatic conditions or rules that are based on smart contracts.\nMoney as content\nOne could argue that bitcoin will have a more significant impact than the Internet itself because the Internet didn\u2019t have its own currency. The Internet was missing a native currency, and bitcoin is just that. We can think of bitcoin as an unbundled piece of content, just like content is unbundled all over the Internet; yet it appears well-integrated in websites, applications and services.\nBitcoin allows money to take a new meaning. If you think of this in evolutionary terms, we used to have content in printed newspapers and magazines, then the Internet came along, and allowed content to move aggressively to digital formats. Content that wanted to be free, became freed up on the Internet, and that created new forms of innovations on top of those models. With cryptocurrency, we can easily decouple the transaction logic from the money itself. Bitcoin will become gradually integrated and embedded right into the fabric of the Internet, and we will see it as native content itself.\nBlockchain technology stack\nThere is a new technology topology that is forming for building applications on top of the bitcoin protocol.\nJoel Monegro of USV has suggested a five-layer\u00a0architecture\u00a0that is blockchain-agnostic: miners and the blockchain; overlay networks; decentralized protocols; open source and commercial APIs; and applications. It is a good depiction of where we\u2019re headed. Whether that exact topology or a variation of it is realized doesn\u2019t matter a lot.\n\n\n\nWhat matters more is that the blockchain concepts, and related technologies are sparking the imaginations of builders and developers who are innovating the form of services, protocols, infrastructure and applications that are decentralized. They are yielding increased consumer power, greater personal data ownership and reduced transaction costs, over the long term.\nDigital rights and smart property\nIf you\u2019re a creator or owner of digital assets, imagine if you could link these assets to the blockchain, binding your ownership (or rights) in irrevocable ways that cannot be undone unless you decide to transfer or sell them. And it\u2019s all within your own control, not someone else\u2019s.\nIn essence, you would be creating a \u201csmart property,\u201d which is an asset or thing that knows who owns it. The blockchain can be used as an auditable database linked to your cryptographic signature, and your smart property becomes linked to a unique digital fingerprint based on its content. Now imagine the portability, flexibility and discoverability aspects that accompany these capabilities, and that becomes a great lubricator for decentralized peer-to-peer trading and commerce.\nCompanies like\u00a0Mine\u00a0are\u00a0enabling creators to establish a persistent link between their identity, reputation, a digital file and its meta-data using the blockchain as the proof of ownership. This will unleash new marketplace opportunities for trading these assets securely and efficiently.\nSmart contracts based on \u201cproof of work\u201d\nA smart contract is equivalent to a little program that you can entrust with money and rules around that money. The basic idea behind smart contracts is that a transaction\u2019s contractual governance between two or more parties can be verified programmatically via the blockchain instead of via a central arbitrator, rule maker or gatekeeper.\nWhy depend on a central authority if two (or more) parties can agree between themselves after\u00a0they bake the terms and implications of their agreement programmatically and conditionally? And do so with automatic money releases, while fulfilling services in a sequential manner or pay penalties, if not fulfilled?\nAt the heart of this undertaking is the key concept of \u201cproof of work,\u201d an integral part of Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s original vision for the blockchain\u2019s role as the unequivocal authenticator of transactions.\nThe proof of work is a \u201cright\u201d to participate in the blockchain system. Expect a not-too-distant future where smart contracts based on proof of work and smart property will be dispensed and executed routinely. Smart contracts are potentially Ethereum\u2019s sweet spot, as they represent its atomic unit at the code level, allowing anyone to write them, along with their own rules.\nDecentralized peer-to-peer marketplaces\nDecentralized peer-to-peer marketplaces are a stepped-up evolution from what we have today in the most successful marketplaces (e.g. Uber, eBay, Amazon). Actually, decentralized peer-to-peer marketplaces threaten to replace some of these existing players that operate semi-centralized markets.\nIn a decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace, anyone sells and anyone buys, while the center controls less but facilitates more.\u00a0Trust, rules, identity, reputation and payment choices are embedded at the peer level. Participants arrive already trusted and decentrally acknowledged.\nExamples of marketplaces and services to support them are being concocted by startups, such as\u00a0La\u2019zooz\u00a0for transportation, or\u00a0OpenBazaar\u00a0for P2P trading. A decentralized P2P marketplace has a lot less friction at the center than traditional marketplaces. There are a lot more power and benefits at the edges than at the center. Here\u2019s a more detailed description of the characteristics and behaviors of\u00a0decentralized P2P marketplaces.\nCryptoequity\nNot only does bitcoin allow companies to mint their own currencies and tie its appreciation to their success, it can also support the full life cycle of equity issuance, governance and trading.\nClassical stock offerings could be replaced by a crypto-crowdfunding scheme. The meaning of \u201cequity\u201d is unbundled, and it is reconfigured on the blockchain, therefore potentially re-evaluating the legal nature of the corporation. This particular scenario is also related to the concept of\u00a0distributed autonomous organizations\u00a0(DAOs), as fully automated business entities that run by interacting with autonomous agents that contribute to its value appreciation by virtue of the collective intelligence and actions of its users.\nThis will allow organizations to have global IPOs from day one of their operations. Although the ramp-up can be slow, value is initially commensurate with the maturity of operations, and as users contribute more value to the decentralized operations, overall value and equity continue to increase. Companies like\u00a0Swarm\u00a0are enabling cryptoequity-in-a-box, along with sophisticated programmable governance based on smart contracts building blocks.\nDecentralized identity\nYour identity is yours and no one else\u2019s. We keep our own passport (although it\u2019s tied to a country) and use it to go anywhere, because it\u2019s widely accepted, but we can hardly move or use our identity from one website to another.\nWhy not decentralize our identities (and even online reputations), along with their parameters, and own them ourselves? Why can\u2019t we arrive at websites or\u00a0web\u00a0services with our own identities and move around that way? A decentralized identity opens the doors to a variety of interesting decentralized applications.\u00a0Openname\u00a0is working on decentralized identity as a building block protocol for decentralized applications.\nA tech renaissance as the path forward\nFor bitcoin to succeed, we need to approach the new things that were not possible before. Copying the current system is only a starting point. It\u2019s better to invent new things instead of fighting all things, and it\u2019s easier to create new systems that circumvent the old ones. \u00a0Of course, bitcoin can replicate some of what is currently being done, but that\u2019s not where most of the interesting developments are.\nTo see innovation, you need to look at the applications and usages inside new, pure bitcoin spaces, ones that are not constrained by the cumbersome legacies of the past.\nThink about new spaces and businesses where you own your identity online, bind your digital assets to the blockchain, and accept payments or get paid in bitcoin or other cryptocurrency, without the need to have an existing bank account. Think about choosing the rules of doing business via smart contracts that protect you. Then attach yourself as a node onto a decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace in order to get discovered and do business.\nThat is the future of the trust web\nBitcoin\u2019s economic success will not depend on a permission to transfer value to it from other financial assets. Bitcoin is its own currency and has its own technology stack, and it is creating its own wealth. Bitcoin\u2019s native wealth creation will dwarf the current value we see from the transfer of fiat money into wallets (approximately $5 billion as of December 2014). Fiat transfers were just a starting point to boot it up.\nThat\u2019s why going head-on against existing stakeholders and regulators is a futile exercise. The bitcoin economy growth will come from the creation and appreciation of its own value around its own ecosystem. For example, users will be paid in cryptocurrency in exchange for real services, decentralized apps members will add crypto value to decentralized organizations by virtue of their actions, and new crypto tokens will continue to be mined and linked to the creation of new business models built on top of blockchain protocols.\nThis is all starting to happen, and it is unstoppable. It\u2019s more than a new paradigm. It\u2019s a renaissance for technology, computer science and cryptography.\n\nFeatured Image: nuvolanevicata/Shutterstock\n"}}, {"pk": 14, "model": "contacts.newscontent", "fields": {"content": "\n\n\nMinh Nguyen, who co-founded the contact management and social networking startup Plaxo (along with Sean Parker), has been charged with first-degree murder, according to the Loudoun County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\nDCInno and NBC Washington both reported the victim\u2019s identity as Corey Mattison, who recently married Nguyen\u2019s ex-wife.\nThe sheriff\u2019s office says Nguyen entered his ex-wife\u2019s home in Ashburn, Virginia on Thursday night, where he allegedly shot and killed Mattison.

He was quick to qualify that statement (only in very defined areas, during good weather, etc.), but that\u2019s one of the few statements that stuck out from the fog of war that is spending a week in Vegas during CES.\nFor years, self-driving cars looked like they were always at least ten years away from coming to market. If the notoriously conservative car industry thinks we are only five years away from somebody selling an autonomous car, then we\u2019re probably even closer than they expect.\nEvery major car manufacturer now makes the pilgrimage to Vegas in January to present its latest advances next to Samsung, Toshiba and hordes of Chinese iPhone case manufacturer \u2014 and if there was is one topic that they all wanted to talk about, it was its self-driving cars. And it wasn\u2019t just the car manufacturers, it was also the chip makers. Nvidia used most of its keynote to give us a rather boring lecture on how its new chips and recent advances in deep learning will enable self-driving cars using only cameras instead of expensive sensors (most car industry experts still think other sensors are absolutely necessary, by the way). All of the products it hyped up during its time on stage were for cars and its booth featured three sports cars. Qualcomm didn\u2019t quite focus on cars quite as much,\u00a0but it announced a number of concept cars that use its chips. Intel talked about autonomy in the context of drones, but there\u2019s no doubt it also wants to put its sensors into cars.\nGoogle obviously wants to play a role in this business, as does Tesla, but despite all of the hype around their projects, Detroit (and Wolfsburg and Munich and Stuttgart and Toyota) may yet beat them to market. All of them are testing some kind of autonomous cars right now. Audi even drove five journalists from L.A. to Vegas in self-driving cars (only Audi prefers to call it \u201cpiloted driving,\u201d maybe because you can\u2019t start branding future technologies too early). Ford says it has autonomous cars on the road right now and the same is pretty much true for everybody else, too.\nFive years isn\u2019t a lot of time, however, and there are plenty of unanswered questions around autonomous driving that still need to be answered. Who is at fault when an autonomous car crashes? How do you keep drivers from getting inattentive and how (and when) do you best hand control back to them? How do you keep drivers from getting carsick? Will driving still be fun? In the long run, there is also a risk for automakers that autonomous cars will change our relationship with our cars and have us rely more on car-sharing services. If that happens, they will sell fewer cars (but for now, growth is still good \u2014 especially in Asia \u2014 so they don\u2019t seem too worried about it).\nBut there are other questions, too. Because autonomous cars will mostly likely have to rely on highly detailed maps, drivers will have to have an ongoing relationship with the manufacturers in order to receive regular updates for them. Does that mean we, as drivers, will have to subscribe to those maps? Will car manufacturers band together and share mapping data?\n\n\n\nThere are also still many regulatory hurdles that need to be overcome before we can sit in the driver\u2019s seat and watch the landscape go by while an increasing complex and smart array of sensors and computers handle the driving for us. Everybody I talked to at CES was sure that whatever would hold autonomous cars back wasn\u2019t going to be technology.\nThe incumbent U.S. car manufacturers may not be the first to bring autonomous cars to market, though. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s less about who is first to market and more about who is the last to have an accident,\u201d a Ford representative told me at one point during the week. A few major accidents in a litigious society like the U.S., after all, will set the whole industry back years. And consumers will not buy these cars until they are absolutely sure they are safe \u2014 and because all drivers think they are great drivers, the autonomous cars have to be significantly better.\nSo over the next few years, expect cars to slowly gain more autonomous features. Adaptive cruise control will morph into a feature that will drive your car autonomously in traffic jams. Lane keeping alerts will turn into real lane keeping while you drive down the highway. Assisted parking will turn into fully autonomous parking. And all of these advances \u2014 plus many others \u2014 will accumulate over time. Hopefully this slow burn will help regulators to keep up and develop a framework that allows the integration of autonomous cars into regular traffic.\nThen, as a final step, we will probably see highways and parts of cities where hand-steered cars will be outlawed because humans are simply too unpredictable and inefficient.\n\nFeatured Image: Google\n"}}]
