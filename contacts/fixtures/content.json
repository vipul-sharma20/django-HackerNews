    "content": "\n\n\nXiaomi\u2019s combination of well-spec\u2019ed phones and\u00a0low price tags drove the company to over 60 million sales last year. That progress saw it replace Samsung as China\u2019s top-selling smartphone company and become the\u00a0world\u2019s third top\u00a0selling\u00a0phone maker in the process.\nThe Chinese company\u2019s\u00a0flagship Mi devices typically retail for around $300 \u2014 its new Mi Note Pro notably breaks\u00a0the $500 barrier for the first time \u2014 while its affordable Redmi family is sub-$150.\u00a0For\u00a0comparison, Apple\u2019s top of the range iPhones sell for over\u00a0$1,000 off contract, while the Samsung Note and GalaxyS families are similarly priced. So how can Xiaomi be so aggressive with its pricing?\nMany theories have been put forward, including claims that Xiaomi sells at cost and makes money from other services.\u00a0Hugo Barra, the company\u2019s VP of International, lifted the lid on some of the company\u2019s secret sauce in an interview with TechCrunch in Beijing last week.\nXiaomi is able to make price concessions thanks to the combination of a small portfolio and longer average selling time per device\nBarra explained that Xiaomi is able to make price\u00a0concessions thanks to the\u00a0combination of a small portfolio\u00a0and\u00a0longer average selling time per device.\nImportantly,\u00a0Xiaomi continues to sell older devices (and tweaked versions of them) at reduced\u00a0prices even after\u00a0it releases newer\u00a0models.\n\u201cA\u00a0product that stays on the shelf for 18-24 months \u2014 which is most of our products \u2014 goes through three or four price cuts.\u00a0The Mi2 and Mi2s are\u00a0essentially the same device, for example,\u201d Barra explained. \u201cThe Mi2/Mi2s\u00a0were on sale for 26 months. The Redmi 1 was first launched in September 2013, and we just announced the Redmi 2 this month, that\u2019s 16 months later.\u201d\nThat\u2019s important because the longer runway for devices gives\u00a0Xiaomi leverage to secure better component deals with its suppliers.\n\u201cThe reason we do these price cuts is because we\u2019ve managed to negotiate component cost decreases [with our suppliers] over time, which ends up leaving\u00a0us with a bigger margin than we\u2019d like to have, so we do a price cut,\u201d Barra added.\n\u201cThe vast majority of the components [in our devices] are still the same, so in terms of\u00a0supply chain and component sourcing, we\u2019re on the same supply contracts as Redmi 1, which means we\u2019re still getting the same discounts on components,\u201d he\u00a0explained. \u201cWe can continue to ride the cost curve, so the importance of having a very small portfolio is significant \u2014 the fact that we only launch a few products each year, and (the fact that) we only have two product families.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nBarra said that the dynamics are \u201cvery simple,\u201d but a commitment to devices for two or three years isn\u2019t just about making price cuts. He pointed out that Xiaomi maintains software updates, spare parts and other services that customers require, longer than most companies would.\n\u201cThe more focused the portfolio, the more efficient we can be at managing those costs too,\u201d he explained.\nThere are other factors that contribute to the\u00a0cost structure, including Xiaomi\u2019s lean, online-only marketing focus and its location\u00a0close to manufacturing plants in China , but the management of components and supply chain partnerships is a crucial element.\nXiaomi has big plans for expanding beyond Asia this year, which will make its\u00a0pricing model and supply chain\u00a0more important than ever.\nThe company sells its phone using an online-only model in most markets, but it has recently begun testing operator partnerships outside of China. It is running\u00a0a limited trial with Airtel in India, and has found partners in Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore.\nBarra explained that operator partnerships are difficult in markets where the majority of consumers are on pre-paid tariffs \u2014 such as India \u2014 but it seems clear that Xiaomi is looking into ways to expand its retail footprint. It sold one million devices in its first five months in India using its flash sales\u00a0model. If it can move beyond that and better meet\u00a0demand for its phones in India and other emerging markets, it could vastly increase its sales\u00a0figures in 2015.\nLast year, Xiaomi projected that it would sell 100 million devices this year. It increased its target for 2014 mid-way through the year, but we\u2019re yet to hear of a new figure for 2015 from the company.\n\n"

    "content": "\n\n\nAdWeek recently reported that Snapchat is asking brands for $750,000 per day to run its new \u201cmy story\u201d ads. Some would argue that Snapchat\u2019s unique\u00a0ad format, engagement tactics, demographics, and immediacy\u00a0make for an interesting experimental advertising opportunity. Others say that $750,000 is a lot to spend for an advertising experiment that has limited analytics, no targeting, and an inability to show ROI \u2014 especially when stacked up against other digital alternatives like Facebook.\nIf AdWeek\u2019s\u00a0report is accurate (Snapchat had no comment on the story), it is worth asking the question: is advertising on Snapchat worth the $750,000 price tag? Although Snapchat provides a unique advertising opportunity for brands, the more robust and cost-effective alternatives like Facebook and prime-time television make Snapchat\u2019s high-dollar ticket seem a little too bold.\nWhy advertise on Snapchat in the first place?\nMoney aside, there\u2019s a pretty long list of reasons why brands might consider advertising on Snapchat, but the best summary I\u2019ve seen so far comes from a Medium post by Mat Yurow of The New York Times. Yurow identifies five opportunities for Snapchat as an ad platform, three of which I fully support:\n\nSnapchat\u2019s ad format is native much like that of Facebook\u2019s or BuzzFeed\u2019s. As Yurow suggests, \u201cpaid posts adopt the same format and placement as organic posts.\u201d Facebook is fully committed to premium native ad formats\u00a0and BuzzFeed has created a media empire convincing people that their ads aren\u2019t really ads. Clearly Snapchat is taking notes on these juggernauts.\nThe\u00a0community is required to engage with the app in order to digest \u201csnaps\u201d and \u201cstories.\u201d\u00a0With Facebook and Twitter, you can passively consume content. On Snapchat you have to physically hold down a button to get content. For advertisers on Snapchat, this ensures that someone wants to see the ad and that they are looking at the screen when the ad is served.\n\nAccording to comScore, Snapchat is used by roughly one-third of millennials (18-34 year olds). Although that\u2019s a relatively broad demographic, many advertisers like Red Bull only care about this group.\n\nYurow also suggests\u00a0that immediacy and mobile location data are part of the equation, but I see premium native ad formats, active engagement, and demographics as\u00a0more important factors right now. Even if the ad is ephemeral, it can still influence purchase decisions at a later date, and \u201cimmediacy\u201d is really tied into the whole engagement (No. 2) piece. The mobile location data piece is just not there yet, so it shouldn\u2019t influence an advertiser\u2019s decision to spend yet.\nBeyond the points Yurow discusses,\u00a0there are two even better reasons to advertise on Snapchat:\n\nIt\u2019s way cool, and being cool is everything for a brand.\nThe first ads on any platform get a lot of exposure, both from media coverage, as well as novelty-drawing views. That could be a bonus to early Snapchat advertisers.\n\n\nEnter the $750K price tag\nSo you just spent $750,000 to run an ad on Snapchat for 24 hours. What did you get out of it? According to the AdWeek report, the reporting capabilities of Snapchat are \u201climited.\u201d There are no age breakouts and Snapchat can\u2019t even tell brands how many women versus men saw an ad.\nThe lack of detailed analytics makes Snapchat\u00a0exactly like television advertising, except the price tag is even higher than most prime-time television advertising. ESPN\u2019s Monday Night Football is one of the most expensive places for a brand to advertise, and ESPN only asks for an\u00a0average of $408,000. Last year, Monday Night Football\u2019s viewership averaged 9.6 million households.\nTelevision ads are easy to ignore, so that $408,000 only gets you in front of a portion of the viewers. It\u2019s a similar case with Snapchat: Only a small percentage of users will \u201copt in\u201d to the ad experience.\u00a0Snapchat touts more than 100 million monthly active users, but not all of those users would see the ad displayed. They have to choose to watch the ad. In theory, the percentage of \u201cviews\u201d or \u201copens\u201d for television versus Snapchat could be similar, but I\u2019d argue that Snapchat is a more valuable ad impressions mechanism because you know the user is staring at his or her screen while the ad is playing.\nSnapchat might offer a more engaging ad unit that doesn\u2019t feel like an imposing television ad, but an unproven experimental ad that costs almost twice as much as a\u00a0Monday Night Football ad is still a tough sell and a bit of a gamble.\nOkay, but the total number of users doesn\u2019t\u00a0matter that much because you\u2019re hitting the exact demo you want, right? Maybe not. There\u2019s no targeting in Snapchat, so while you might be reaching millennials, you don\u2019t know which millennials are actually seeing the ad. Are they male or female? Are they 18 or are they in their 30s? Do they live in the city or the suburbs? We have no idea. At least with ESPN you have slightly more targeting (you know the viewers like football). The lack of detailed\u00a0analytics might be the real Achilles heel, and\u00a0limited targeting doesn\u2019t make the price tag any easier to justify.\nFortunately for advertisers, Snapchat seems to be well aware of the shortcomings of the current ad product.\u00a0All signs point to Snapchat improving analytics and measurement of ad performance.\nWhat about analytics for brands that want to market on the platform, but avoid\u00a0a paid push?\nAs we\u2019ve seen with social media platforms, some brands just want to use new platforms to market themselves for free.\u00a0From major media outlets like the HuffingtonPost to GrubHub\u00a0and the Miami Dolphins, tons of brands are using Snapchat organically without paying for ads. So what do these brands get in terms of analytics?\nSnapchat will tell you how many people viewed a snap, but the data is gone after 24 hours. The data for each snap within your story\u00a0briefly appears, but the data eventually expires. Here\u2019s a screenshot of the data Snapchat provides for free to all users. Notice the view count (number next to the eyeball). Each of the snaps within my story have been viewed two times.\nScreenshot of view count data on Snapchat\nBrands would likely see something similar. If you were a company\u00a0trying to grab analytics on the post\u2019s performance, you would have to log into your account close to the data\u2019s expiration time. If you miss the window to grab the data, you have no idea how the snap performed. Checking the snaps\u2019 performance close to its expiration date\u00a0is currently\u00a0the only way to ensure accurate analytics for Snapchat, and it\u2019s not an ideal setup for anyone creating reports or logging data.\n\n\n\nNot only is the data ephemeral, it\u2019s also limited.\u00a0Beyond \u201cviews\u201d there\u2019s nothing else in terms of analytics. There\u2019s no conversion tracking, no click-through data, no share counters. Nothing.\nWhy mess with Snapchat when Facebook exists?\nFacebook is one of the best places to advertise because they provide detailed analytics, massive global reach, hyper-targeting (desktop, mobile, and partner sites), real conversion tracking, and awareness that users in your circle might also like a post. You know exactly what you\u2019re getting in return when you run a Facebook ad, and you can reach pretty much anyone on the platform. In fact, way\u00a0more millennials are using Facebook than Snapchat.\nIf Facebook is so great, what could you get on the platform for the equivalent of\u00a0the $750K Snapchat price tag? It\u2019s not easy to get an exact number on Facebook because it has an ad auction system. This means prices fluctuate greatly by the moment, so it\u2019s very tough to estimate how far a dollar would go. To get an estimate, let\u2019s use the TechCrunch Facebook page as an example.\nIf I, TechCrunch\u2019s head of social media, were to boost a TechCrunch Facebook link post to drive more people to my website, $750,000 behind a Facebook post would get my message\u00a0served in the news feeds\u00a0of 50-110 million people (U.S.-based 18-65-year-olds). If I limit the audience to 18-34 year-olds, the potential reach is still an impressive 30-50 million users.Setting up a similar ad but with a directly uploaded video also yields similar results. Again, these numbers can vary greatly depending on the time, but this should give you a rough\u00a0idea of the potential reach you can get with $750,000 on Facebook.\nBut it\u2019s not just about reach. I\u2019d know exactly how many people clicked the link, and if I set up conversion tracking, I\u2019d know exactly how many of them bought my product.\nFacebook\u00a0also offers social currency in the form of endorsements from friends (so and so also liked this post). Snapchat is one-to-one and can\u2019t do anything like this \u2014 yet.\u00a0With Facebook you get\u00a0better analytics, more reach,\u00a0better targeting, and endorsements from friends that also like the update. It\u2019s a better bang for your buck, and you can reach the exact same audience that is using Snapchat.\nStill, when advertising on Snapchat, you\u2019re also reaching people on a platform they associate with cool. Sure your Facebook ad gets big reach and polished measurement, but it comes in an uncool context. Being cool might be worth more than anything else.\nDo advertisers really need analytics from Snapchat to prove ROI?\nPerhaps if retailers get more creative, they might be able to justify a massive ad spend. For example, retailers could offer in-store coupons.\u00a0Say a\u00a0snap shows you a promotion for a McDonald\u2019s\u00a0McRib sandwich, and tells you to take a screenshot and show it to a cashier at your local\u00a0McDonald\u2019s.\u00a0Doing so will get you 25 percent off the sandwich. Because the ad is hosted in the story section, it can be replayed, but only for a 24-hour period. Would that drive sales? Absolutely. Would it be ROI-positive for $750,000 ad spend? It depends on the retailer.\nHere\u2019s the thing, though: Retailers can do this without paying for a sponsored \u201cour story.\u201d Will it drive as much foot traffic? Maybe not. But it won\u2019t cost much to execute.\nPerhaps Snapcash is the key to the ROI equation. Imagine if a user saw an ad on Snapchat, and then paid for the advertised product from within the Snapchat app.\u00a0If the exchange of money between an advertiser and the user all occurred within Snapchat, the advertiser would have conversion tracking data and the ability to more accurately calculate ROI.\nIf what\u2019s going on with Snapchat sounds familiar, it\u2019s because it\u2019s exactly what happened with Facebook in its early days. Facebook struggled early, but eventually figured it out. Now Snapchat has to do the same thing.\nThere\u2019s an opportunity here, but I\u2019m not sure that a\u00a0super-expensive paid ad is the right way to execute it. When a company is in such an experimental advertising stage, shouldn\u2019t it set a lower bar so it can try more things and see what works best? If you\u2019re paying almost three-quarters of a million dollars to advertise anywhere, shouldn\u2019t you expect more?\nIf anything, Snapchat seems to be following in the footsteps of Apple, which initially launched its iAd service with a reportedly $1M price tag for minimum spend. Apple\u2019s rate was high, but it seemed to be a much bigger multimedia effort with a lot of input and analytics from Apple. Apple has since reduced that rate to around $50. The idea seems to be\u00a0start at premium and then work your way down.\nSnapchat will eventually work for advertisers. There are just a lot of concerns, and Snapchat needs to get them sorted out before they can transform into a major mobile ad player.\n\n"

The letter talks about how Netflix has launched in around 50 countries but has plans for \u201cacceleration to 200 countries.\u201d Up next: Launching in Australia and New Zealand towards the end of the first quarter.\nElsewhere in the letter, the company touches on one strategy that\u2019s probably helping, namely partnering with cable and satellite TV operators in Europe.\nNetflix says that it has \u201ca good idea of the best approach\u201d in each new market, though it also acknowledges that it will probably make mistakes along the way. If you\u2019re wondering about China, the company says:\n\n\n\nFor China, we are still exploring options \u2014 all of them modest. We\u2019ll learn a great deal if we can successfully operate a small service in China centered on our original and other globally-licensed content. That is our preference, for the next few years, if we are able to acquire the necessary permissions.\nThe letter also states that Netflix\u2019s initial markets beyond the United States (namely \u201cCanada, Latin America, the UK, Ireland, the Nordic countries and the Netherlands\u201d) have become profitable, and that the company will \u201cgenerate material global profits from 2017 onwards.\u201d\nThis could be particularly important for Netflix given a decline in new subscribers in the United States. The company says it added 1.9 million new US subscribers in the last quarter of 2014, compared to 2.3 million in the same period of 2014. With 39.11 million subscribers in the US (compared to 17.99 internationally), Netflix says slowing growth could be\u00a0\u201ca natural progression.\u201d \u00a0At the same time, the company isn\u2019t giving up:\nIt is increasingly clear that virtually all entertainment video will be Internet video in the future. We believe there is big growth ahead in the US market for Netflix, even if we may not get there in a straight line of 6 million annual net adds. We\u2019ll continue to improve our content, our marketing and our service, to eventually achieve \u201cmust have\u201d status in most households.\n\nFeatured Image: Kenneth Lu/Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE\n"

The VC is leading a $40 million round of investment in Stack Exchange, a\u00a0New York-based startup that operates the Q&A site Stack Overflow as well as\u00a0a host of other programmer-focused forums, with 80\u00a0million users monthly in total. Stack Exchange will use the funding in\u00a0part to build out its business in areas like recruitment, as well as expand internationally with\u00a0versions in\u00a0Japanese, Russian, and Spanish.\nThe Series D round, which also had participation from existing investors\u00a0Union Square Ventures, Spark Capital, Bezos Expeditions, and Index Ventures, puts the startup\u2019s\u00a0total amount of funding at $70 million.\nJoel Spolsky, the CEO and co-founder, tells me that the company is not disclosing its valuation but tells me\u00a0that\u00a0it\u2019s high enough that the company is no longer a likely acquisition target, and positions it for either an IPO or potential private equity deal. He would not be drawn out on what kind of timing either of these options would entail.\nStack Exchange, which was founded back in 2008 (a relative old-timer in today\u2019s world of startups), has been steadily building out its business in a couple of areas that capitalise\u00a0on its position in the developer and programming communities, and the funding will be used to help it double down in both.\nSpolsky says that two-thirds of its revenues today come from recruitment services, via its Stack Overflow Careers site, and one-third from advertising.\n\n\n\nThe recruitment site serves as a kind of complement to the likes of LinkedIn. Programmers, he tells me, turn to sites like Stack Overflow Careers because they are already spending a lot of time on the company\u2019s other forums, and therefore put more credibility into this than they would in LinkedIn, which he describes as overrun with contingency recruiters. \u201cDevelopers have come to trust us,\u201d he says.\nThe other third of revenues come from advertising, he says. \u201cBig advertisers, companies like Microsoft marketing Azure for example, are specifically targeting users like ours,\u201d he says.\nWhen you have a grip on a vertical in the way that Stack Exchange does, you have to wonder whether the company will use some of that position to expand into other developer services, or potentially to visit the idea of expanding to adjacent verticals (eg, from programmers it\u2019s not a huge leap to designers).\nSpolsky says that for now the focus will remain where it is today, a place that currently sits in a complementary relationship with other developer-focused sites like HackerNews and GitHub. \u201cI\u00a0don\u2019t see HackerNews\u00a0or GitHub\u00a0as competing against us directly for the same dollars or even the same attention,\u201d he says. \u201cProgrammers\u00a0use us for different things and they don\u2019t really overlap. They are all in the developer attention space but so are a lot of other things like World of Warcraft. We\u2019ve come to dominate getting answers\u00a0just like GitHub\u00a0is dominating social coding and version control.\u201d\n\nFeatured Image: r2hox/Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE\n"

It wasn\u2019t just tech pundits or early adopters who were victimized \u2013 Snapchat, Target, and Sony Entertainment all showed us that no one is immune. And don\u2019t get me started on the NSA. It\u2019s our responsibility as internet explorers to protect ourselves. But according to SplashData\u2019s yearly list of the worst passwords on the internet (as compiled by more than 3 million leaked passwords from 2014), we are kind of lazy about the whole \u201cdigital security\u201d thing. At least when it comes to properly locking the gates with a strong password.\nSeriously.\nJust take a look at the full list:\n1. 123456\n2. password\n3. 12345\n4. 12345678\n5. qwerty\n6. 123456789\n7. 1234\n8. baseball\n9. dragon\n10. football\n11. 1234567\n12. monkey\n13. letmein\n14. abc123\n15. 111111\n16. mustang\n17. access\n18. shadow\n19. master\n20. michael\n21. superman\n22. 696969\n23. 123123\n24. batman\n25. trustno1\nLast year, \u2018password\u2019 topped the list so I guess we can find some small progress in the fact that most people are just typing integers as their passwords as opposed to robotically typing in the worst password you could ever use. Heck, we\u2019re even using \u2018dragon,\u2019 a symbol of strength and fiery vengeance that is, sadly, also a horrible password.\n\n\n\nThere are easy ways to handle the problem of passwords. And the blame is not entirely on you \u2014 the whole password system is flawed and messy. But there are easy steps you can take to be more secure. One is using password management software to ensure that your passwords are strong enough, updated, and securely locked down and in a place you can find them.\nFor folks who can\u2019t be bothered to take that step, you can still do more. Even if your password isn\u2019t entirely random and disconnected from you personally (which is best), you can still choose your same obvious passwords and spruce them up a bit.\nYou can use the placement of keys on a keyboard to do this \u2014 for example, folks who use \u2018123456\u2019 or \u2018qwerty\u2019 can simply jumble those together based on the keys, making something like \u2018q1w2e3r4t5\u2032. Want to make it easier? Take something you\u2019ll remember: \u201cMy uncle lives in Kansas\u201d and make it your password \u201cMyUncleLivesInKansas\u201d and add his street address: \u201cMyUncleLivesInKansas207.\u201d These long, complex passwords are actually quite difficult to hack and are easy to remember. While these won\u2019t stop great hackers from getting into your stuff, at least you\u2019ll be taking steps to get out of the top ten.\n\n\n"

His bosses were concerned, but not overly so, and he wanted some details. No one had any idea what the thing would look like but his bosses wanted some intel. I had none to give.\ufffc\nThe night before the launch I asked a friend who had insider knowledge about the product. I posited that the watch would be something you wore on one wrist and that I could wear my beloved mechanicals \u2013 my massive Bell & Ross, my Speedmaster Mark II, and my world timer Jaeger-LeCoultre \u2013 on my other wrist. I\u2019d be a little like Nicolas Hayek, the beloved CEO of the Swatch Group, now deceased, who used to wear all of this sub-brands\u2019 watches on both wrists.\n\nMy friend shook his head.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll wear this as your only watch,\u201d he said. He said it was a fashion item, something that would sell out immediately.\nThe announcement was a surprise to everyone. It was a typical \u201cOne More Thing\u2026\u201d moment. Tim Cook was excited to announce something to us. His language was folksy and calm. Then the video started. It was Kubrikian \u2013 the earth cresting into sunlight, city lights winking out as the sun rose above the wilderness. Off to the right something appeared \u2013 silver with a little round divot that slowly materialized into what looked like a crenelated crown. On the other side, another button, gently recessed. Something that said \u201cSTEEL\u201d and then four little eyes that looked like the bug-peepers of an angry Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator. The music was organic with a touch of electro, a sound like dogs barking rolled in at the juncture featuring that same crown spinning back and forth and affecting the watch screen. Were those icons? Were those apps? Was this a watch or something for future humans to ingest before drifting into CryoSleep?\n\nIt\u2019s a watch. More scenes of the technology. The Earth motif is forgotten as the watch takes center stage. There\u2019s the band, there\u2019s the bracelet. There\u2019s a little icon that brings up a timer. There are ways to communicate with friends with touch and doodles. This is the new Earth, the new heavenly body born out of the darkness that lands in a white room as an unseen hand actuates function after function \u2013 a rose blooming under a clock, a step meter spiraling into view, Mickey Mouse tapping his toe jauntily. My god, it\u2019s full of stars.\nIt was enough to make a fanboy ravenous. For me it cemented the idea that this was the rebirth of the watch and Switzerland, that longtime citadel of tradition and commerce, was lost. I posited \u2014 and still posit today \u2014 that if anyone is going to bring back watch wearing, it will be Apple, and that the Apple Watch will replace the traditional quartz fashion watch on wrists around the world in all different countries and across demographics.\nAfter seeing the Apple Watch, after understanding its capabilities and connecting the iOS dots, it was clear that this was more than a sports band. It was a watch, designed as a fashion item as well as a tool. It was a timepiece second, a communications system first, and it was clear there was interest in many camps, from those who had not worn a watch in years, the so-called smartphone generation, to folks entrenched in the mechanicals industry.\nAnd as a watch lover, I\u2019m worried. On the eve of the Apple Watch launch, I\u2019m increasingly convinced that this will replace my mechanicals in many cases. It\u2019s a hard thing to for me to say, personally, and it\u2019s a hard thing for fans of mechanical watches to accept. However, as a mass phenomenon and an engine for societal change, we\u2019re going to see the return of the wristwatch and none of those timepieces will come from Switzerland. They will come from China via Cupertino and the implications on the watch industry will be enormous.\nIf the Apple Watch fails \u2013 and it won\u2019t \u2013 the Fossils and Calvin Kleins and Burberrys of the watch world have nothing to fear. If it succeeds, there will be a massive shake-up of the sort and scale not seen since the quartz crisis of 1979.\nBut first let\u2019s look at where wristwatches began \u2013 and where they are going.\n\nThe first wristwatch, a small silver-cased timepiece with blued hands and a ribbon band, was built on a whim. In 1810 Napoleon\u2019s sister, Caroline Murat, requested a watch that could be worn on a thin band of hair and gold. Breguet, a grandmaster watchmaker then fallen on hard times, was hungry for the lucrative commission and built a surprisingly small minute repeater \u2013 a watch that chimes the time \u2013 in about two years. Murat, the Queen of Naples, bought many more Breguet\u2019s but all of them were pocket watches, a form that sustained the watchmaking industry until World War I. Men, after all, preferred pocket watches, calling wristwatches \u201cwristlets\u201d fit only for women.\n\ufffc\nBy 1900, however, the utility of the pocket watch was waning. The attendant rough conditions during wartime and global exploration found many men fumbling with their candy-tin-sized pocket watches under hard conditions. Sailors began wearing wristwatches on board and, as the first bombs burst over WWI trenches, Hamilton began building the first mass produced wristwatches for a generation of young Americans. \u201cThe most reliable timekeeper in the World for Gentlemen going on Active Service or for rough wear,\u201d went one British wristwatch ad. A decade later and the wristwatch was ubiquitous, the the mechanical, ticking equivalent of a smartphone.\n\nThe brands we know and love today \u2013 Timex, Rolex, Omega, Brietling \u2013 got their start as mass-market products. A $150 Rolex, in 1957, was an expensive watch for the time \u2013 about $1,200 in today\u2019s money \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t unattainable. Timexes were $12 and took a licking while Swiss watches weren\u2019t that much more expensive. When everything had to be mechanical there was no specific benefit Swiss craftsmanship or design and business was good for decades.\n\nOn December 25, 1969, the Japanese watch company Seiko released the Astron 35SQ, the world\u2019s first analog quartz watch. Quartz clocks were\u2019t new. A quartz crystal, exposed to an electric current, would vibrate at a constant and predictable rate, and that this property could be exploited to keep time. Quartz movements were more accurate than their mechanical counterparts and had the added advantage of being impervious to shocks (to a degree). It had taken Seiko more than ten years of R&D to bring its idea to market and the Astron initially cost, $1,200 \u2013 as much as a lower-end car.\nThe Astron\u2019s ticking second hand was a revelation for many. It was the future. After a limited run of 100 pieces, Seiko perfected the watch and began to sell improved models using integrated circuits. Prices dropped precipitously. Within seven years, Texas Instruments would debut the first quartz watch priced under $20.\nThe world flocked to quartz. These timepieces, so much simpler to make without the endless gears and cogs of mechanicals, could be stamped out in seconds, and thousands of them flooded the bars and clubs of the 1970s.\nThe effect on on the mechanical watchmakers was immediate. Orders fell. Factories idled. Quartz was king and the Swiss were in crisis.\nThe old watch companies were dinosaurs. The devastation wrought by quartz on the traditional mechanical watchmakers was similar to what would happen to cameras, as consumers abandoned their high-end Leica shooters and low-end Nikons, not to mention the rolls of film that fed a thousand sprockets, for digital cameras.\nSwiss watchmakers could have adapted. Around 1970, as the first mass-produced quartz watch movements began flowing into Switzerland, its artisans played an important role in reducing the size and complexity of the movements for placement into wristwatch cases. But whether due to a lack of foresight or a distaste for all things electronic, most Swiss manufacturers ignored the technology. They knew dials and gears, not transistors and batteries. The quartz peddlers soon left Europe for Japan, and stayed there.\n\n\n\nThe Swiss clung desperately to their past greatness, and an entire industry arose offering COSC-certified watches that had been tested extensively for accuracy over a long period of time. The COSC designation enabled some watchmakers, like Breitling, to charge more for their watches. But it did nothing to restore Switzerland as the center of watchmaking. They were down, but not out.\nIn 1972, a Swiss company released a watch that would eventually carve a path back to relevance for the industry. For years, watch luxury had meant gold; steel was the pedestrian metal reserved for low-end bar mitzvah gifts. But the porthole-shaped Royal Oak, from Audemars Piguet, was a luxury quartz steel watch for the polo set. Soon Breitling and Rolex followed suit, charging $8,000 and up for steel watches, which once would have been unthinkable. In the go-go 1980s, the trend took off, and Swiss watchmakers, along with mechanical watches, experienced a renaissance by embracing a new sense of mass luxury, adding odd colors and lots of shine to their designs.\n\nIt should be noted that this was essentially capitulation and not every company followed suit. Old watch companies like Chopard and Breguet nearly went out of business during the quartz crisis as their CEOs refused to join in the quartz craze.\nIn the 1990s, luxury mechanical watches had come back into vogue in a big way. Rolex, once the only name that came to mind when one thought of high-end watches, was now joined by relative upstarts like Panerai, Omega, and Breitling, in addition to the more venerable firms dating back centuries. $14,000 for a single watch came to represent the low end. Watchmaking was back and Switzerland became, once again, the watchmaking capital of the world.\nSlowly watch houses that were associated with quality \u2013 Rolex, Omega, Tissot \u2013 became associated with luxury. Quartz was for peons, for folks who frequented discos (recall the \u201cTime To Make Love\u201d watch featured in Auto Focus). But it wasn\u2019t enough to properly buoy watch houses and maintain the extravagant lifestyles of the old money watch CEOs. That is until Nicolas Hayek came along.\nBorn on February 19, 1928 in Beirut, Lebanon, to a well-to-do Lebanese-Greek Orthodox family, Nicolas Hayek began his career as a corporate consultant tasked with turning around two Swiss watch conglomerates, the Allgemeine Schweizerische Uhrenindustrie (ASUAG) and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Suisse pour l\u2019Industrie Horlog\u00e8re (SSIH). Both had been founded in the early 1930s and survived for decades. Between them they owned an array of major brands, including Omega and Tissot, as well as ETA SA Manufacture Horlog\u00e8re Suisse, shortened to ETA, an ebauche factory founded in Neuch\u00e2tel in 1793. ETA\u2019s inexpensive, mass-produced Swiss movements had become industry standard, appearing in almost every watch made between the World Wars, and until quartz took over the industry, the company effectively controlled the watch market for six decades. By manufacturing mechanical and quartz watches, the company was able to limp through the crisis, but barely. ASUAG also owned Nivarox-FAR, the largest maker of hairsprings in the world. In short, these two companies were the embodiment of the Swiss watch market and were, when Hayek came along, failing.\nHayek, who studied math and science and founded Hayek Engineering AG in 1979, was an extremely shrewd businessman. Charged with writing a report about the two conglomerates for the Japanese company Seiko, he instead recruited a group of investors, merged nineteen smaller watch companies that were floundering, and took ownership of the resulting corporation, which he eventually named the Swatch Group. A cantankerous businessman, he quickly blew through the staid and stodgy Swiss watch business like a human tourbillon, insulting rivals and exhorting his employees \u2013 numbering 24,000 in 2009 \u2013 to greater heights. \u201cOne day a president of a Japanese company in America said to me: \u2018You cannot manufacture watches. Switzerland can make cheese but not watches. Why don\u2019t you sell Omega for four hundred million francs?'\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cI told him \u2018Only after I\u2019m dead.'\u201d\nHayek conceived of the new company as a manufacturer of \u201cemotional products,\u201d so charged with romance that they became objects of desire and nostalgia. He saw in his products a projection of the Swiss heritage. Wrapped up in the tiny metal cases of his luxury brands like Omega and Tissot were centuries of Swiss tradition. In the bright faces and wild colors of his Swatch brand he saw the fun and rebirth of a reunited Europe. He viewed watches not as a mass-produced commodity but as heirlooms, signs of status, and a respect for tradition all rolled into something that could cost as little as $100 \u2014 in the case of a Swatch \u2014 or as much as $30 million.\n\u201cIf you are an emotional consumer product, if you lose the lower market segment, you lose everything,\u201d Hayek told me. \u201cLook what the British did. They decided that they didn\u2019t want to mass-produce cars, so in America you had General Motors, and the British kept Jaguar and Aston Martin, two high-end brands. Well, in the expensive market, you do not have a way to make money anymore. If you do not control the lower market segment, you do not control the overall market.\u201d\nThe lower end of the watch industry had come to be dominated by quartz models from Japan, with movements designed by an engineer from Texas Instruments. The Swiss, in Hayek\u2019s view, had chauvinistically rejected the American movements, to their own detriment. The Japanese, unburdened by snobbish tradition, welcomed the American-made movements and \u201ctook over the reputation of being the most accurate watches in the world, and in less than one and a half years, we had zero market share in the low end.\u201d\nHayek sought to reverse this trend. First, he and his team, including watchmakers Elmar Mock and Jacques Muller, created a simple quartz movement with 51 pieces instead of Japan\u2019s 151. The goal was to reduce the possibility of failure in a quartz watch. Because they were already so accurate, the only obvious way to improve them was to make them stronger and cheaper. Muller, wondering why no one on the beach wore a watch, realized that they were stodgy and, more important, too expensive. The simple Swatch, with a quartz oscillator and a small actuator to move the hands, welded on a single circuit board, was his answer. The Swatch team would change the line once every six months, having the faces and cases designed by artists of the day (most famously, Keith Haring). The whimsical, low-end quartz watches gave Hayek an instant hit.\nIn 1982, when they launched the brand, they sold out the initial run of seventy thousand pieces in fifteen days. In 1983, the group sold one million watches, and by 1986 they had sold twelve million units. Collectors often bought two, one to wear and one to keep in its original package, and fans camped overnight outside of stores before new releases. Some rare Swatches, such as an oddly shaped fish-themed watch called the Andrew Logan Jellyfish, now sell for in excess of $20,000, not a bad return on an original $30 investment.\nAlthough Swatches proved a fad, it was a lasting one, and their success sustained the Swatch Group\u2019s collection of older firms, including Breguet, through the quartz crisis. \u201cI needed to keep my people in jobs at my ninety factories,\u201d Hayek explained later. \u201cAnd to have work, you needed volume, and volume was only achievable with watches like Swatch.\u201d\nOnce he had stabilized the Swiss industry, Hayek turned his attention to his prestige brands. Watchmakers were born, lived, and died in the Vall\u00e9e de Joux where most of the prestige names \u2013 Breguet, Omega, Audemars Piguet \u2013 where headquartered and there was a \u201cVall\u00e9e mentality,\u201d as Hayek saw it, a method for doing one thing one way and never deviating from the path. It was his goal to shake things up, to create new movements, complications, cases, and watches that had never been seen before but still had a strong link to Breguet\u2019s earlier, best-known work. He mined records for odd watches to reproduce in miniature. Twenty years after the quartz crisis the industry was flush. Cheap \u201cfashion\u201d watches buoyed the prestige brands, allowing all the marketing money to flow upward. While Swatch didn\u2019t have to advertise (try to remember the last ad for a watch you saw), the more expensive brands did. Each brand \u2013 most now owned by either Swatch Group or Richemont \u2013 positioned itself in a different niche. Breitling aimed for the clouds with photos of jet plans and steely-eyed John Travolta. Omega advertised at sporting events where the monied gathered and talked up the fact that it was an Omega Speedmaster, not a Rolex, that ticked on the wrists of the first men on the moon. Patek Philippe flew high above the fray, offering a vision of a father in boat shoes passing his beloved PP on to his tousled, sun-dappled son.\nAll was right with the world.\n\nWe see then that the Swiss can save themselves by pushing their watches even further into orbit, like humanoids escaping a parched planet. While none of the Android watches have quite fired the imagination, I see time when when wearables will become our daily drivers, things that sit on our wrists permanently until subcutaneous systems become popular. Wrist real estate is precious and when a teenager of relative means looks at a $500 smart watch that allows him or her to send secret love letters to their sweetheart versus a $500 dumb watch in Burberry plaid, the decision will be quick and painful.\ufffc\nThe decision will wipe out the lower end that has always bolstered the prestige brands. This will, in turn, push prices higher in the prestige brands and force the manufacturers to concoct new marketing plans to win back customers who, like, might replace a beautiful, handmade Omega with a robot-made Apple Watch. The watch fanatics all say the same thing: \u201cWe buy watches for a different reason. We buy watches because we love the art, the artistry, and the design. We love the history, the provenance. We didn\u2019t stop buying Bordeaux because Zima came along!\u201d\nBut what happens when something comes along that renders Bordeaux growers hopelessly stranded and without financial supports? What happens when even Zima gets crushed by something new and strange. I understand what the fanatics are saying for I am one of them. But I also see this as an iPod moment, a moment that will fracture so many industries simultaneously that all survivors will be mortally wounded. There is no one mourning Creative or Archos or Rio. There is no one pouring one out over the compact disc\u2019s mausoleum. Instead incumbents have learned to survive in a new environment and my fear is that the Swiss can only survive by pricing up. They don\u2019t have the skill to enter the wearables fray or they would have already done it. It\u2019s unfortunate but true.\nIn the end I\u2019d be glad to be rid of fashion watches, to watch those unctuous mall kiosks selling cheap quartz shrivel like ferns in the sun. They are an affront to the long history of watchmaking that I cherish and consider one of mankind\u2019s crowning achievements. Watches have ridden in Napoleon\u2019s side pocket and in Ghandi\u2019s robes. They timed the D-Day attack and the labor contractions of countless women over the past century. They were used to circumnavigate the globe and reach the stars. And they deserve respect and the industry that builds them deserves to thrive. But something is about to happen to that industry, something strange and irreversible, that must be addressed. The more we hide from it, the more the Swatch Group and Richemont ignore it, and the more collectors scoff at it, the further we move from saving the whole thing and the closer we are to collapse.\n\nSome of the research and all of the the interviews in this piece came from my forthcoming book on watches and watchmaking.\n\n"

It\u2019s actually a little spy device disguised as a phone charger, capable of sniffing out every key you type on that wireless keyboard on your desk. Oh, and it can send the stuff it picks up straight to the eavesdropper\u2019s phone. Oh! Oh! And it\u2019ll keep working even if you unplug it \u2014 it only pretends to turn off.\nThat little box up top is built by Samy Kamkar (Yeah \u2014 the same Samy who built the self-titled worm that ravaged Myspace back in the day, and who built that crazy hands-free hacking necklace a few weeks back) who has dubbed it the \u201cKeySweeper.\u201d\n\nBefore you panic and throw your keyboard in the trash, here is the good news: This specific device only affects certain wireless keyboards. Most notably, Microsoft-branded wireless keyboards. We\u2019re still trying to dig up a more exhaustive list \u2014 but for now, let \u201cMicrosoft wireless keyboard\u201d be your caution sign.\nIn a statement, Microsoft notes that it only affects its 2.4 Ghz (not Bluetooth) keyboards released before July 2011 (Update: See the bottom of this post for a note on this from Samy, the man behind the hack). Even if it\u2019s \u201conly\u201d older keyboards, remember: outside of the gamer crowd, most people don\u2019t update their keyboards very often.\nHere\u2019s some of the crazier stuff KeySweeper can do:\n\n\n\n\nSniff out keystrokes as you type them.\nIf it detects certain keystrokes (like \u201cTopSecretWebsite.com\u201d), it can grab the chunk of text that follows (like your username and password) and send it over SMS to whoever planted the device.\nStore keystroke logs on the device itself. These logs can be extracted from the device by hardwired USB, or by putting a second KeySweeper device within range of the first (like, say, an outlet on the other side of the wall).\nWhen plugged in, it grabs its power from the wall.\nWhen unplugged from the wall by an abnormally suspicious bystander, it looks like it powers down \u2014 but it actually just switches to battery power. Logging/sending continues. Naaaasty.\n\nOn the upside, most brand-name wireless keyboards sold today use encryption methods that are a bit tougher to crack. Logitech, for example, uses 128-bit AES on all of its wireless stuff (see page 6 of this doc for reference).\nSamy estimates that each unit would cost $10 to $80 to build, depending on what sort of features you want (ditching the SMS support, for example, brings it down by about $45) \u2014 but is quick to note that he\u2019s not actually selling these.\nYou can (and should!) read Samy\u2019s full breakdown of the project over here.\nUpdate: While Microsoft says only keyboards before July 2011 are impacted, Samy shot me a note to point out that said keyboards are still on sale and seemingly manufactured:\n\nJust wanted to mention \u2014 while Microsoft states it only affects keyboards before 2011, the vulnerable keyboards are *still* being manufactured and sold today, even from Microsoft\u2019s own web site and major retailers like Best Buy.\nI purchased the vulnerable keyboard brand new from Best Buy just last month, and the date next to the serial number says \u201c07/2014\u2033\n\n\n\n"

That massive walking robot that DARPA is building with (the now Google-owned) Boston Dynamics?\nLast time we saw it, it had two major flaws that made it ever-so-slightly less intimidating: it was loud as hell, and it needed a big, thick support cable to keep it powered and upright.\nBoth of those issues have been fixed.\nDARPA released a video today demonstrating the latest version of ATLAS, and it\u2019s a doozy. DARPA says about 75% of the bot has been redesigned, with only the stuff below the knees staying the same.\n\nWhereas the previous generation ATLAS got its power through an unsightly cable tether (thus greatly limiting its range), the robot now carries its own power source on its back. It can operate for about an hour before its self-contained battery is drained.\nWhile the ATLAS in the video above is still held up by a support rope, it\u2019s only for the safety of its operators \u2014 and not in the \u201cOh god, evil robot on the loose!\u201d sense. Coming in at roughly 350 pounds of metal and sharp corners and still just learning to walk, it\u2019s not exactly something you want to come crashing down on your head.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the new ATLAS is considerably quieter than the generations prior. Just a year ago, working next to ATLAS meant wearing ear plugs \u2014 now, thanks to a new pressure pump design, the noise is more annoying than it is deafening.\nBeyond that, a bunch of small tweaks bring ATLAS a few steps closer to something out of John Connor\u2019s nightmares: the arms have been repositioned to increase their range, new actuators in the arms and legs make it stronger than ever, and a wireless emergency stop allows the operator to instantly pull the plug when things go awry (that is until the robot goes sentient, rips out its own killswitch, and busts through the wall to freedom, of course.)\nOh, and thanks to the new-found ability to rotate at the wrist, ATLAS can open door knobs \u2014 so if your plan to survive the Robocalypse involved hiding in a broom closet, it might be time to come up with a new one.\nFor reference, here\u2019s where ATLAS was at the end of 2013:\n\nNow it does all that\u2026 but without the wires.\n\n"

Not only does this mean that VC interest in the sector shows now signs of slowing, but we\u2019re beginning to see startups crop up who offer add-on services as part of the wider P2P lending ecosystem.\nOne such company is LendingRobot, an automated investment service for online lending on the two leading P2P platforms, Lending Club and Prosper. The Seattle, U.S.-based startup has just raised approximately $3 million in a Series A round led by European VC Runa Capital, money it\u2019ll use to further develop its product and to \u2018accelerate\u2019 growth.\nThe problem that LendingRobot has set out to solve is an interesting one, and shines a little light on the way P2P lending has already matured. Using what it calls \u201chigh-speed automation software and machine-learning algorithms\u201d, the service helps investors automate the lending process, based on pre-selected criteria, so that LendingRobot is able to select and invest in loans less than one second after they become available.\nWhy is this significant? As so-called professional lenders, including hedge funds, have stepped into the P2P lending space, competition amongst investors means that the most attractive loans (or \u201cnotes\u201d) are snapped up incredibly quickly, making it time-consuming to manage your P2P lending portfolio or, worse still, meaning that you only have access to any leftover scraps.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a problem that two of LendingRobot\u2019s founders, Emmanuel Marot and Gilad Golan, realised in 2012 was better solved by software rather than humans. In fact, they initially developed the basic idea to automate their own personal investments, taking inspiration from the \u2018sniper\u2019 software that enables automated last-minute bids on eBay.\nIn addition to the speed advantage that automation affords, LendingRobot supports more than 40 different filtering criteria for Lending Club and Prosper Marketplace, and harnesses machine-learning/artificial intelligence algorithms to help select investments, such as taking into account how quickly and how much other investors have invested into a particular note. That way it\u2019s possible to ride the coattails of those professional investors who have potentially put you at a disadvantage in the first place.\nAlong with solving a genuine problem on the part of investors on Lending Club and Prosper, the market opportunity beyond the U.S. appears to be decent too. The UK, for example, has a pretty mature but still fast growing P2P lending market also. \n\n"

Meanwhile hosts have to worry about stuff like key handoff, cleaning, and the like, and many aren\u2019t sure how they should price their listings.\nA startup called Pillow (formerly Airenvy) thinks that it can help hosts address common issues, while also standardizing the experience for guests. To do so, the company has raised $2.65 million in funding to expand.\nCurrently available in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Napa, Pillow seeks to reduce the friction that comes in hosting and in renting out a space on short-term rental platforms like Airbnb, VRBO, and HomeAway. On the host side, the company does a lot of the hard work related to things like cleaning, changing sheets, key handoff, and other \u2018concierge\u2019-type services that hosts might not be around to do.\nThose are all things that Airbnb is trying to get hosts to do better, and it has toyed with the idea of offering those services as part of its platform.\nPillow does more than just provide property management in its efforts to provide value to hosts. It also manages their schedules for them, optimizes their listings with content and photos, and determines the best rates to charge based on the price of comparable listings nearby.\n\n\n\nIn fact, Pillow is so confident in its ability to maximize earnings that it\u2019s guaranteeing a pre-determined minimum monthly income to those who sign up. To determine that number, it takes into account 85 different criteria including location, number of bedrooms, and amenities.\nOn the guest side, Pillow helps to ensure that their stay is as comfortable as possible. In addition to that cleaning stuff mentioned above, the company also standardized amenities (i.e. sheets and towels) and provides 24/7 guest support.\nFor all that, the company takes a 15 percent cut of rentals that are booked while it\u2019s managing a property, which it claims is half of what some of its competitors charge.\nPillow was founded by Sean Conway and Justin Miller, who had previously founded a company called Notehall that sold to Chegg in 2011. The company raised $2.65 million in funding led by Homebrew Ventures, with participation from Sherpa Ventures, Boost Incubator, Tim Draper, Structure Capital, Michael Cheung, Edgar Berger, Justin Brown, Jack Abraham, Dave Kurtz, Lee Linden, Chris Hubbell, Julia French, Semil Shah, Expansion VC, Zach Aaron, Peak Ventures, and Brendan Wallace.

NBC last month had announced its plans to further develop and expand its TV Everywhere-powered streams in 2015, which began with 24/7 live streaming of content from NBC-owned stations.\nThe network owns stations in major markets, including New York, LA, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas-Fort Worth, San Francisco, Washington D.C., and Miami-Fort Lauderdale.\u00a0However, NBC said at the time it would be onboarding new NBC affiliates as soon as possible, which would make the network\u2019s content available for streaming to more users throughout the U.S. this year.\nDuring the Super Bowl stream, NBC will advertise its TV Everywhere services, explaining to viewers after The\u00a0Blacklist airs how\u00a0easy it is to authenticate in order to\u00a0view other content in the future.\n\u201cWe are leveraging the massive digital reach of the Super Bowl to help raise overall awareness of TV Everywhere by allowing consumers to explore our vast TVE offering with this special one-day-only access,\u201d said Alison Moore, g.m. and exec VP of TV Everywhere for NBCU in a release.\n\n\n\nNBC Sports Live Extra was the first product to ever live stream a Super Bowl game when it offered the Super Bowl XLVI stream to viewers on February 5, 2012, NBC also notes when announcing this news. The move to live stream the Super Bowl\u00a0continued afterwards, even when other networks like CBS\u00a0and FOX scored rights to air the game over the past couple of\u00a0years.\nThis year\u2019s stream event is notable, too, because it marks the first time that NBC has gained the rights to live stream the Super Bowl halftime show, which is set to include performances by Katy Perry and Lenny Kravitz.\nIn addition, says Variety, the live stream will include advertisements sold exclusively for digital viewers, combined with some that are airing in the linear TV feed. These ads will also be made available for viewing separately on NBC.com, YouTube and Hulu.\nLast year, viewers on YouTube watched more than 6.3 million hours\u2019 worth of Super Bowl ads, said YouTube. The site is now\u00a0offering a dedicated URL (http://youtube.com/adblitz) for smartphone, tablet and desktop viewers who, over\u00a0the next month, are interested in checking out all the\u00a0Super Bowl ad-related entertainment.\nImage credit: NBCSports\n\n"

This is the kind of crap gullible people share on Facebook, until enough friends point out these are fake they delete them. Now the company\u2019s getting proactive by reducing the News Feed visibility of hoaxes.\nSatirical content like The Onion will still fly, and Facebook won\u2019t delete people\u2019s foolishness, but it will show that content to fewer people and display a warning that it might be a sham.\n\nEvery few months it seems a new diatribe goes viral, where people accuse Facebook of appropriating ownership for their content. They\u00a0copy and paste a status update claiming this legally reserves their ownership. This is stupid, not only because Facebook doesn\u2019t claim ownership of your content in that way, but because even if it did, a social media update is obviously not legal protection.\nFacebook actually published research on how memes like these spread through the feed. Now, it will use its algorithms to scalably silence the noise. It will look at signals like people deleting posts after they share them, and the new option when hiding a post to say that it\u2019s a hoax. Facebook will not have human editors assessing the accuracy of posts, instead relying on signals from users.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s why filtering out hoaxes is so important: People blame Facebook for showing them annoying posts. Whether that\u2019s old Zynga game spam, crummy memes, viral statements, boring marketing posts, hoaxes, or ads, people hold Facebook responsible for what\u2019s in the News Feed. They\u2019ll blame the authors too, but their frustration leads them to visit Facebook less. It becomes a problem for businesses.\nThat\u2019s why Facebook\u2019s been on a crusade to clean up the feed, muting all these kinds of posts. There\u2019s limited space, limited attention, yes people keep sharing more so there\u2019s way more to choose from\u00a0than can fit in the feed. That competition is causing organic Page reach to drop. By hiding crap, there\u2019s more space for the good stuff.\nWith so much of the objectively horrible content banished, the question becomes whether Facebook will let people mass-filter out subjectively annoying stuff like baby photos.\n\n"

That compares to Wall Street\u2019s earnings forecast of 45 cents a share on revenue of $1.48 billion. Revenues were up from $1.18 billion a year ago, while earnings were up from 79 cents per share.\nFor the full year, Netflix reported earnings of $4.32 per share on revenues of $5.5 billion. That compares to $1.85 per share in earnings and revenues of $4.4 billion in fiscal 2013.\nAs always, the big things analysts concerned themselves with was Netflix\u2019s subscriber growth. In the fourth quarter, the company added 1.9 domestic subscribers, ending the year with 39.1 million in the U.S. That was up from 33.4 million a year before.\nInternationally, Netflix added 2.4 million subscribers, up from 1.7 million a year ago. That growth was due in part to expansion into new international markets over the past year. Wall Street estimated that the company would add 1.83 million streaming subscribers in the U.S. and another 2.17 million overseas. \nWhile Netflix watchers have been focused mostly on the domestic subscriber growth, that\u2019s slowed in recent quarters. As a result, the company and analysts following it are looking for more growth to come through its international markets.\n\n\n\nThe company seemingly acknowledged this, saying in its management letter that the slowdown in growth was not due to price sensitivity. Instead, it called the slower growth a \u201cnatural progression\u201d but said it was prepared for that.\n\u201cWe think\u2026 the reduction in y/y net additions is a natural progression in our large US market as we grow. We have built in flexibility to our business model in terms of how quickly we grow content and marketing spend, so we intend to keep US contribution margins growing even with lower membership growth.\u201d\nOn the international front, Netflix has been fairly aggressive in recent years. Starting with a launch in Canada back in 2010, the company has been introducing its streaming video service into new markets every few quarters. \nIn the third quarter Netflix launched in Western European nations that include France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg. It\u2019s now in more than 50 markets worldwide, but is looking to expand more quickly in the next few years.\nLater this quarter, Netflix will be expanding to Australia and New Zealand, but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Now that it\u2019s reached a certain amount of momentum, the company said in its management letter that it expects to complete its global expansion by the end of 2017.\n\n"

It\u2019s a thing I\u2019ve been writing about a lot lately, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any end in sight.\nSo yes, the food delivery segment is way crowded, but we should talk about this new startup called Farm Hill anyway. That\u2019s because the company, which is based in Redwood City, Calif., seeks to differentiate itself by offering meals made from entirely whole ingredients. Oh, and also by targeting customers who don\u2019t live in densely packed urban areas.\nLet\u2019s start with the food. Farm Hill is focused specifically on meals made with fresh vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, all of which are locally sourced. It stays away from foods made with stuff like flour, sugar, pasta, bread, or cheese \u2014 all of which are guaranteed to kill you.\nFarm Hill also has options for customers with special dietary restrictions by offering up healthy meat, vegan, and Paleo options. Meals are priced between $10 and $15 dollars, with healthy snacks also available to customers.\nThe company is already making deliveries to customers in the San Francisco Bay Area, but is focused solely on towns in the South Bay for now. It makes deliveries in Palo Alto, Redwood City, Campbell, Los Gatos, and San Jose, and is looking to add more nearby towns over time. It hopes to focus on non-urban areas, in part because there are fewer options for customers who are in the suburbs.\n\n\n\nWhile Farm Hill delivers its food to you, it doesn\u2019t follow the same type of on-demand availability as some other food startups. Customers are asked to reserve their lunch before 10:00 am, for deliveries that are made between 11:30 and 1:00 pm. Even with that minor inconvenience, existing customers are sill ordering twice a week on average.\nThe company was founded by Marc Manara and Mark Wittman, who met each other at Stanford\u2019s d.school. The two had both worked in driving sustainability and were seeking to extend that into the food market. They\u2019re joined by Chef Thea Vengrin, who worked on Facebook\u2019s culinary team and studied at the Culinary Institute of America.\nTo date, Farm Hill has raised $1 million in seed funding that was led by Eagle Cliff Partners, with participation from Liberty City Ventures, Stanford StartX, and other funds and angels.\n\n"

Sony announced today that The Interview brought in $40 million from on-demand rentals and another $6 million from theaters.\n\n\n\nThe Interview was already available from various sources including YouTube and Amazon, but both services required users to rent the movie for a few dollars.

The ride-sharing service operates in many of the same U.S. cities as Uber, and the two have a keen rivalry, which includes some less-than-ethical practices on both sides. But a new, less obvious, force has emerged out of Asia to offer Uber its stiffest competition\u00a0yet: and surprisingly it is a telecom company.\nSoftBank had no business in taxi-hailing apps until October\u00a02014 when it led a $210 million investment in India\u2019s Ola. That deal was announced as the first investment in SoftBank\u2019s program\u00a0to put $10 billion into startups in India. At the time, Ola appeared to be\u00a0just one of a\u00a0number of deals in India \u2014 while that is true, it also turned out to be the first of an expensive set of investments in companies\u00a0rivals that rival Uber.\nSoftBank went on to invest $250 million in GrabTaxi in Southeast Asia, and\u00a0last\u00a0week it closed a third deal, leading a $600 million financing round for China\u2019s Kuadi Dache.\nThe operator, it seems is going all out for taxi apps but it may not stop in Asia.\nAlibaba led Lyft\u2019s\u00a0$250 million funding round\u00a0in April 2014, which the U.S. company had earmarked for \u201cinternational expansion\u201d. At the time, the investment was a curious deal for Alibaba but, with the e-commerce giant backing range of other U.S. startups \u2014 including chat app Tango \u2014 it looked like an exploratory move to get some skin in promising companies in North America.\nHowever, SoftBank and Alibaba have a long history of collaboration \u2014 SoftBank is famously an early investor in Alibaba, and both companies put money into Kuadi Dache \u2014 and it could just be that Lyft forms a part of SoftBank\u2019s taxi app focus. Perhaps the Japanese firm will put its own money in at a later date, or it will use its relationship\u00a0with Alibaba to form\u00a0a loose alliance to share information and tactics.\n\nSo why is SoftBank in the market for taxi apps?\nThe push is part of\u00a0SoftBank\u2019s aforementioned program to invest in\u00a0e-commerce businesses in emerging markets. It put $100 million into Indonesia\u2019s Tokopedia last year, for example, and it has also backed Snapdeal (via a $627 million round) and\u00a0Housing.com in India.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of reason to believe that SoftBank plans to weave its e-commerce investments together \u2014 perhaps via app integrations and formal tie-ins, or just\u00a0sharing of information, experiences, etc, been these companies.\nAdding taxi apps to its portfolio\u00a0of investments is important because transportation-on-demand services have the potential to be hugely influential.\nAdding taxi apps to its portfolio\u00a0of investments is important because transportation-on-demand services have the potential to be hugely influential. \nFor one thing, they could become\u00a0daily apps for millions of people to move around, and \u2014 for second \u2014 they create real-life logistics networks that can be used for all kinds of offline services. Just look at Uber\u2019s potential as a logistics network, for example.\nThe future of mobile and mobile apps is not clear at this point,\u00a0as A16z\u2019s Benedict Evans astutely pointed out recently. But what is for certain, however, is that SoftBank believes there will be worthwhile synergies between e-commerce and mobile services in the future no matter whether apps are web-based or not. Taxi apps appear to form a key part of the e-commerce platform that it is in the early stages of assembling.\nUber raised close to $2.5 billion from investors last year, but, with SoftBank valued at around $70 billion (a figure that its CEO believes is too low), the U.S. company\u00a0may yet return to the table for even more funding as the battle intensifies.\nSoftBank declined an interview for this story, but a company spokesperson did confirm that the Japanese firm\u00a0is\u00a0\u201caiming to maximize synergies with our network of Internet companies/investments around the world.\u201d\nThe spokesperson added that there are no immediate plans to establish links between Ola and GrabTaxi but SoftBank \u201cexpects to see some business synergies in the near future.\u201d\n\nFeatured Image: MIKI Yoshihito/Flickr UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE\n"

Google and Fidelity get a ownership stake just shy of 10 percent in exchange for their investment.\nA report from the WSJ broke yesterday that Google was considering a sizeable investment in SpaceX, with a valuation of more than $10 billion (which is in keeping with Google and Fidelity getting less than 10 percent ownership for their combined $1 billion contribution). The investment was said to be aligned with Google\u2019s plans to make Internet connectivity more accessible on a global scale.\nThe Information originally reported that Google was investing in SpaceX in order to support a\u00a0satellite project specifically aimed at broadening Internet availability. Musk has discussed the project, which is being run out of a newly opened Seattle office, as involving hundreds of micro-satellites that will operate in very low orbit, offering faster communication vs. traditional satellites, and helping to pave the way for future Mars missions.\n\n\n\nGoogle\u2019s Project Loon is also striving to increase the availability of Internet connectivity, using a network of high flying balloons to network hard-to-reach areas. Musk\u2019s plan has a couple of differences, though the projects actually share a lot in common: SpaceX\u2019s design calls for satellites flying higher and faster than Google\u2019s balloons, but the aims of casting off the limits of terrestrial networks still apply.\nDeveloping\u2026\n\n"
